<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he plan of this Work is simple, and yet it is novel. In its distinctive
features it differs from any compilation that has yet
been made. Its main purpose is to present to American
households a mass of good reading. But it goes much beyond this.
For in selecting this reading it draws upon all literatures of all time
and of every race, and thus becomes a conspectus of the thought
and intellectual evolution of man from the beginning. Another and
scarcely less important purpose is the interpretation of this literature
in essays by scholars and authors competent to speak with authority.</p>

<p>The title, &quot;A Library of the World's Best Literature,&quot; is strictly
descriptive. It means that what is offered to the reader is taken from
the best authors, and is fairly representative of the best literature
and of all literatures. It may be important historically, or because
at one time it expressed the thought and feeling of a nation, or
because it has the character of universality, or because the readers
of to-day will find it instructive, entertaining, or amusing. The
Work aims to suit a great variety of tastes, and thus to commend
itself as a household companion for any mood and any hour. There
is no intention of presenting merely a mass of historical material,
however important it is in its place, which is commonly of the sort
that people recommend others to read and do not read themselves.
It is not a library of reference only, but a library to be read. The
selections do not represent the partialities and prejudices and cultivation
of any one person, or of a group of editors even; but, under
the necessary editorial supervision, the sober judgment of almost as
many minds as have assisted in the preparation of these volumes.
By this method, breadth of appreciation has been sought.</p>

<p>The arrangement is not chronological, but alphabetical, under the
names of the authors, and, in some cases, of literatures and special
subjects. Thus, in each volume a certain variety is secured, the
heaviness or sameness of a mass of antique, classical, or mediaeval
material is avoided, and the reader obtains a sense of the varieties
and contrasts of different periods. But the work is not an encyclopaedia,
or merely a dictionary of authors. Comprehensive information
as to all writers of importance may be included in a supplementary
reference volume; but the attempt to quote from all would destroy
the Work for reading purposes, and reduce it to a herbarium of
specimens.</p>

<p>In order to present a view of the entire literary field, and to make
these volumes especially useful to persons who have not access to
large libraries, as well as to treat certain literatures or subjects when
the names of writers are unknown or would have no significance to
the reader, it has been found necessary to make groups of certain
nationalities, periods, and special topics. For instance, if the reader
would like to know something of ancient and remote literatures
which cannot well be treated under the alphabetical list of authors, he
will find special essays by competent scholars on the Accadian-Babylonian
literature, on the Egyptian, the Hindu, the Chinese, the
Japanese, the Icelandic, the Celtic, and others, followed by selections
many of which have been specially translated for this Work. In
these literatures names of ascertained authors are given in the Index.
The intention of the essays is to acquaint the reader with the spirit,
purpose, and tendency of these writings, in order that he may have
a comparative view of the continuity of thought and the value of
tradition in the world. Some subjects, like the Arthurian Legends,
the Nibelungen Lied, the Holy Grail, Proven&ccedil;al Poetry, the Chansons
and Romances, and the Gesta Romanorum, receive a similar treatment.
Single poems upon which the authors' title to fame mainly
rests, familiar and dear hymns, and occasional and modern verse of
value, are also grouped together under an appropriate heading, with
reference in the Index whenever the poet is known.</p>

<p>It will thus be evident to the reader that the Library is fairly
comprehensive and representative, and that it has an educational
value, while offering constant and varied entertainment. This comprehensive
feature, which gives the Work distinction, is, however,
supplemented by another of scarcely less importance; namely, the
critical interpretive and biographical comments upon the authors and
their writings and their place in literature, not by one mind, or by a
small editorial staff, but by a great number of writers and scholars,
specialists and literary critics, who are able to speak from knowledge
and with authority. Thus the Library becomes in a way representative
of the scholarship and wide judgment of our own time. But the
essays have another value. They give information for the guidance
of the reader. If he becomes interested in any selections here given,
and would like a fuller knowledge of the author's works, he can turn
to the essay and find brief observations and characterizations which
will assist him in making his choice of books from a library.</p>

<p>The selections are made for household and general reading; in the
belief that the best literature contains enough that is pure and elevating
and at the same time readable, to satisfy any taste that should
be encouraged. Of course selection implies choice and exclusion.
It is hoped that what is given will be generally approved; yet it
may well happen that some readers will miss the names of authors
whom they desire to read. But this Work, like every other, has its
necessary limits; and in a general compilation the classic writings,
and those productions that the world has set its seal on as among
the best, must predominate over contemporary literature that is still
on its trial. It should be said, however, that many writers of present
note and popularity are omitted simply for lack of space. The
editors are compelled to keep constantly in view the wider field.
The general purpose is to give only literature; and where authors
are cited who are generally known as philosophers, theologians, publicists,
or scientists, it is because they have distinct literary quality,
or because their influence upon literature itself has been so profound
that the progress of the race could not be accounted for without
them.</p>

<p>These volumes contain not only or mainly the literature of the
past, but they aim to give, within the limits imposed by such a
view, an idea of contemporary achievement and tendencies in all
civilized countries. In this view of the modern world the literary
product of America and Great Britain occupies the largest space.</p>

<p>It should be said that the plan of this Work could not have been
carried out without the assistance of specialists in many departments
of learning, and of writers of skill and insight, both in this country
and in Europe. This assistance has been most cordially given, with
a full recognition of the value of the enterprise and of the aid that
the Library may give in encouraging and broadening literary tastes.
Perhaps no better service could be rendered the American public at
this period than the offer of an opportunity for a comprehensive
study of the older and the greater literatures of other nations. By
this comparison it can gain a just view of its own literature, and of
its possible mission in the world of letters.</p>

<h2>NOTE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-o.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>wing to the many changes in the assignment of topics and
engaging of writers incident to so extended a publication
as the Library of the World's Best Literature, the Editor
finds it impossible, before the completion of the work, adequately
to recognize the very great aid which he has received from a large
number of persons. A full list of contributors will be given in one
of the concluding volumes. He will expressly acknowledge also his
debt to those who have assisted him editorially, or in other special
ways, in the preparation of these volumes.</p>

<p>Both Editor and Publishers have endeavored to give full credit to
every author quoted, and to accompany every citation with ample
notice of copyright ownership. At the close of the work it is their
purpose to express in a more formal way their sense of obligation to
the many publishers who have so courteously given permission for
this use of their property, and whose rights of ownership it is intended
thoroughly to protect.</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Books are not absolutely dead things, but do contain
a potency of life in them to be as active as that
soul was whose progeny they are; nay, they do preserve
as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that
living intellect that bred them. I know they are as
lively, and as vigorously productive, as those fabulous
dragon's teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance
to spring up armed men. And yet on the other hand,
unless wariness be used, as good almost kill a man as kill
a good book: who kills a man kills a reasonable creature,
God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason
itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the eye.
Many a man lives a burden to the earth; but a good
book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit, embalmed
and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life.</i><br><br>

<h3>BY THOMAS DAVIDSON</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-p.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ierre, the eldest son of B&eacute;renger and Lucie (Ab&eacute;lard?) was
born at Palais, near Nantes and the frontier of Brittany,
in 1079. His knightly father, having in his youth been a
student, was anxious to give his family, and especially his favorite
Pierre, a liberal education. The boy was accordingly sent to school,
under a teacher who at that time was making his mark in the
world,--Roscellin, the reputed father of Nominalism. As the whole
import and tragedy of his life may be traced back to this man's teaching,
and the relation which it bore to the
thought of the time, we must pause to consider
these.</p>

<p class="rgt"><img src="images/021.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>In the early centuries of our era, the two
fundamental articles of the Gentile-Christian
creed, the Trinity and the Incarnation,
neither of them Jewish, were formulated
in terms of Platonic philosophy, of which
the distinctive tenet is, that the real and
eternal is the universal, not the individual.
On this assumption it was possible
to say that the same real substance could
exist in three, or indeed in any number of
persons. In the case of God, the dogma-builders
were careful to say, essence is one with existence, and therefore
in Him the individuals are as real as the universal. Platonism,
having lent the formula for the Trinity, became the favorite philosophy
of many of the Church fathers, and so introduced into Christian
thought and life the Platonic dualism, that sharp distinction between
the temporal and the eternal which belittles the practical life and
glorifies the contemplative.</p>

<p>This distinction, as aggravated by Neo-Platonism, further affected
Eastern Christianity in the sixth century, and Western Christianity
in the ninth, chiefly through the writings of (the pseudo-) Dionysius
Areopagita, and gave rise to Christian mysticism. It was then erected
into a rule of conduct through the efforts of Pope Gregory VII., who
strove to subject practical and civil life entirely to the control of
ecclesiastics and monks, standing for contemplative, supernatural life.
The latter included all purely mental work, which more and more
tended to concentrate itself upon religion and confine itself to the
clergy. In this way it came to be considered an utter disgrace for
any man engaged in mental work to take any part in the institutions
of civil life, and particularly to marry. He might indeed enter into
illicit relations, and rear a family of &quot;nephews&quot; and &quot;nieces,&quot; without
losing prestige; but to marry was to commit suicide. Such was
the condition of things in the days of Ab&eacute;lard.</p>

<p>But while Platonism, with its real universals, was celebrating its
ascetic, unearthly triumphs in the West, Aristotelianism, which maintains
that the individual is the real, was making its way in the East.
Banished as heresy beyond the limits of the Catholic Church, in the
fifth and sixth centuries, in the persons of Nestorius and others, it
took refuge in Syria, where it flourished for many years in the schools
of Edessa and Nisibis, the foremost of the time. From these it found
its way among the Arabs, and even to the illiterate Muhammad, who
gave it (1) theoretic theological expression in the cxii. surah of the
Koran: &quot;He is One God, God the Eternal; He neither begets nor is
begotten; and to Him there is no peer,&quot; in which both the fundamental
dogmas of Christianity are denied, and that too on the ground
of revelation; (2) practical expression, by forbidding asceticism and
monasticism, and encouraging a robust, though somewhat coarse,
natural life. Islam, indeed, was an attempt to rehabilitate the human.</p>

<p>In Ab&eacute;lard's time Arab Aristotelianism, with its consequences for
thought and life, was filtering into Europe and forcing Christian
thinkers to defend the bases of their faith. Since these, so far as
defensible at all, depended upon the Platonic doctrine of universals,
and this could be maintained only by dialectic, this science became
extremely popular,--indeed, almost the rage. Little of the real
Aristotle was at that time known in the West; but in Porphyry's
Introduction to Aristotle's Logic was a famous passage, in which all
the difficulties with regard to universals were stated without being
solved. Over this the intellectual battles of the first age of
Scholasticism were fought. The more clerical and mystic thinkers, like
Anselm and Bernard, of course sided with Plato; but the more
worldly, robust thinkers inclined to accept Aristotle, not seeing that
his doctrine is fatal to the Trinity.</p>

<p>Prominent among these was a Breton, Roscellin, the early instructor
of Ab&eacute;lard. From him the brilliant, fearless boy learnt two
terrible lessons: (1) that universals, instead of being real substances,
external and superior to individual things, are mere names (hence
Nominalism) for common qualities of things as recognized by the
human mind; (2) that since universals are the tools and criteria of
thought, the human mind, in which alone these exist, is the judge
of all truth,--a lesson which leads directly to pure rationalism, and
indeed to the rehabilitation of the human as against the superhuman.
No wonder that Roscellin came into conflict with the church authorities,
and had to flee to England. Ab&eacute;lard afterwards modified his
nominalism and behaved somewhat unhandsomely to him, but never
escaped from the influence of his teaching. Ab&eacute;lard was a rationalist
and an asserter of the human. Accordingly, when, definitely adopting
the vocation of the scholar, he went to Paris to study dialectic under
the then famous William of Champeaux, a declared Platonist, or realist
as the designation then was, he gave his teacher infinite trouble
by his subtle objections, and not seldom got the better of him.</p>

<p>These victories, which made him disliked both by his teacher and
his fellow-pupils, went to increase his natural self-appreciation, and
induced him, though a mere youth, to leave William and set up a
rival school at M&eacute;lun. Here his splendid personality, his confidence,
and his brilliant powers of reasoning and statement, drew to him a
large number of admiring pupils, so that he was soon induced to move
his school to Corbeil, near Paris, where his impetuous dialectic found
a wider field. Here he worked so hard that he fell ill, and was
compelled to return home to his family. With them he remained for
several years, devoting himself to study,--not only of dialectic, but
plainly also of theology. Returning to Paris, he went to study rhetoric
under his old enemy, William of Champeaux, who had meanwhile,
to increase his prestige, taken holy orders, and had been made
bishop of Ch&acirc;lons. The old feud was renewed, and Ab&eacute;lard, being
now better armed than before, compelled his master openly to withdraw
from his extreme realistic position with regard to universals,
and assume one more nearly approaching that of Aristotle.</p>

<p>This victory greatly diminished the fame of William, and increased
that of Ab&eacute;lard; so that when the former left his chair and
appointed a successor, the latter gave way to Ab&eacute;lard and became
his pupil (1113). This was too much for William, who removed his
successor, and so forced Ab&eacute;lard to retire again to M&eacute;lun. Here he
remained but a short time; for, William having on account of unpopularity
removed his school from Paris Ab&eacute;lard returned thither and
opened a school outside the city, on Mont Ste. G&eacute;n&eacute;vi&egrave;ve. William,
hearing this, returned to Paris and tried to put him down, but in
vain. Ab&eacute;lard was completely victorious.</p>

<p>After a time he returned once more to Palais, to see his mother,
who was about to enter the cloister, as his father had done some
time before. When this visit was over, instead of returning to Paris
to lecture on dialectic, he went to Laon to study theology under the
then famous Anselm. Here, convinced of the showy superficiality of
Anselm, he once more got into difficulty, by undertaking to expound
a chapter of Ezekiel without having studied it under any teacher.
Though at first derided by his fellow-students, he succeeded so well
as to draw a crowd of them to hear him, and so excited the envy
of Anselm that the latter forbade him to teach in Laon. Ab&eacute;lard
accordingly returned once more to Paris, convinced that he was
fit to shine as a lecturer, not only on dialectic, but also on theology.
And his audiences thought so also; for his lectures on Ezekiel were
very popular and drew crowds. He was now at the height of his
fame (1118).</p>

<p>The result of all these triumphs over dialecticians and theologians
was unfortunate. He not only felt himself the intellectual
superior of any living man, which he probably was, but he also
began to look down upon the current thought of his time as obsolete
and unworthy, and to set at naught even current opinion. He was
now on the verge of forty, and his life had so far been one of spotless
purity; but now, under the influence of vanity, this too gave
way. Having no further conquests to make in the intellectual world,
he began to consider whether, with his great personal beauty, manly
bearing, and confident address, he might not make conquests in the
social world, and arrived at the conclusion that no woman could reject
him or refuse him her favor.</p>

<p>It was just at this unfortunate juncture that he went to live
in the house of a certain Canon Fulbert, of the cathedral, whose
brilliant niece, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, had at the age of seventeen just returned
from a convent at Argenteuil, where she had been at school. Fulbert,
who was proud of her talents, and glad to get the price of
Ab&eacute;lard's board, took the latter into his house and intrusted him
with the full care of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se's further education, telling him even
to chastise her if necessary. So complete was Fulbert's confidence
in Ab&eacute;lard, that no restriction was put upon the companionship of
teacher and pupil. The result was that Ab&eacute;lard and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, both
equally inexperienced in matters of the heart, soon conceived for each
other an overwhelming passion, comparable only to that of Faust and
Gretchen. And the result in both cases was the same. Ab&eacute;lard, as a
great scholar, could not think of marriage; and if he had, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se
would have refused to ruin his career by marrying him. So it came
to pass that when their secret, never very carefully guarded, became
no longer a secret, and threatened the safety of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, the only
thing that her lover could do for her was to carry her off secretly to
his home in Palais, and place her in charge of his sister. Here she
remained until the birth of her child, which received the name of
Astralabius, Ab&eacute;lard meanwhile continuing his work in Paris. And
here all the nobility of his character comes out. Though Fulbert and
his friends were, naturally enough, furious at what they regarded as
his utter treachery, and though they tried to murder him, he protected
himself, and as soon as H&eacute;lo&iuml;se was fit to travel, hastened to
Palais, and insisted upon removing her to Paris and making her his
lawful wife. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se used every argument which her fertile mind
could suggest to dissuade him from a step which she felt must be his
ruin, at the same time expressing her entire willingness to stand in
a less honored relation to him. But Ab&eacute;lard was inexorable. Taking
her to Paris, he procured the consent of her relatives to the marriage
(which they agreed to keep secret), and even their presence at the
ceremony, which was performed one morning before daybreak, after
the two had spent a night of vigils in the church.</p>

<p>After the marriage, they parted and for some time saw little of
each other. When H&eacute;lo&iuml;se's relatives divulged the secret, and she
was taxed with being Ab&eacute;lard's lawful wife, she &quot;anathematized and
swore that it was absolutely false.&quot; As the facts were too patent,
however, Ab&eacute;lard removed her from Paris, and placed her in the
convent at Argenteuil, where she had been educated. Here she
assumed the garb of a novice. Her relatives, thinking that he must
have done this in order to rid himself of her, furiously vowed vengeance,
which they took in the meanest and most brutal form of
personal violence. It was not a time of fine sensibilities, justice, or
mercy; but even the public of those days was horrified, and gave
expression to its horror. Ab&eacute;lard, overwhelmed with shame, despair,
and remorse, could now think of nothing better than to abandon the
world. Without any vocation, as he well knew, he assumed the
monkish habit and retired to the monastery of St. Denis, while
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, by his order, took the veil at Argenteuil. Her devotion and
heroism on this occasion Ab&eacute;lard has described in touching terms.
Thus supernaturalism had done its worst for these two strong,
impetuous human souls.</p>

<p>If Ab&eacute;lard had entered the cloister in the hope of finding peace,
he soon discovered his mistake. The dissolute life of the monks
utterly disgusted him, while the clergy stormed him with petitions to
continue his lectures. Yielding to these, he was soon again surrounded
by crowds of students--so great that the monks at St. Denis
were glad to get rid of him. He accordingly retired to a lonely cell,
to which he was followed by more admirers than could find shelter
or food. As the schools of Paris were thereby emptied, his rivals did
everything in their power to put a stop to his teaching, declaring
that as a monk he ought not to teach profane science, nor as a layman
in theology sacred science. In order to legitimatize his claim to
teach the latter, he now wrote a theological treatise, regarding which
he says:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;It so happened that I first endeavored to illuminate the basis of our
faith by similitudes drawn from human reason, and to compose for our students
a treatise on 'The Divine Unity and Trinity,' because they kept asking
for human and philosophic reasons, and demanding rather what could be
understood than what could be said, declaring that the mere utterance of
words was useless unless followed by understanding; that nothing could be
believed that was not first understood, and that it was ridiculous for any one
to preach what neither he nor those he taught could comprehend, God himself
calling such people blind leaders of the blind.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Here we have Ab&eacute;lard's central position, exactly the opposite to
that of his realist contemporary, Anselm of Canterbury, whose principle
was &quot;Credo ut intelligam&quot; (I believe, that I may understand).
We must not suppose, however, that Ab&eacute;lard, with his rationalism,
dreamed of undermining Christian dogma. Very far from it! He
believed it to be rational, and thought he could prove it so. No wonder
that the book gave offense, in an age when faith and ecstasy
were placed above reason. Indeed, his rivals could have wished for
nothing better than this book, which gave them a weapon to use
against him. Led on by two old enemies, Alberich and Lotulf, they
caused an ecclesiastical council to be called at Soissons, to pass judgment
upon the book (1121). This judgment was a foregone conclusion,
the trial being the merest farce, in which the pursuers were the judges,
the Papal legate allowing his better reason to be overruled by their
passion. Ab&eacute;lard was condemned to burn his book in public, and to
read the Athanasian Creed as his confession of faith (which he did
in tears), and then to be confined permanently in the monastery of
St. M&eacute;dard as a dangerous heretic.</p>

<p>His enemies seemed to have triumphed and to have silenced him
forever. Soon after, however, the Papal legate, ashamed of the part
he had taken in the transaction, restored him to liberty and allowed
him to return to his own monastery at St. Denis. Here once more
his rationalistic, critical spirit brought him into trouble with the bigoted,
licentious monks. Having maintained, on the authority of Beda,
that Dionysius, the patron saint of the monastery, was bishop of Corinth
and not of Athens, he raised such a storm that he was forced
to flee, and took refuge on a neighboring estate, whose proprietor,
Count Thibauld, was friendly to him. Here he was cordially received
by the monks of Troyes, and allowed to occupy a retreat belonging
to them.</p>

<p>After some time, and with great difficulty, he obtained leave from
the abbot of St. Denis to live where he chose, on condition of not
joining any other order. Being now practically a free man, he
retired to a lonely spot near Nogent-sur-Seine, on the banks of the
Ardusson. There, having received a gift of a piece of land, he established
himself along with a friendly cleric, building a small oratory
of clay and reeds to the Holy Trinity. No sooner, however, was
his place of retreat known than he was followed into the wilderness
by hosts of students of all ranks, who lived in tents, slept on the
ground, and underwent every kind of hardship, in order to listen to
him (1123). These supplied his wants, and built a chapel, which he
dedicated to the &quot;Paraclete,&quot;--a name at which his enemies, furious
over his success, were greatly scandalized, but which ever after
designated the whole establishment.</p>

<p>So incessant and unrelenting were the persecutions he suffered
from those enemies, and so deep his indignation at their baseness,
that for some time he seriously thought of escaping beyond the
bounds of Christendom, and seeking refuge among the Muslim. But
just then (1125) he was offered an important position, the abbotship
of the monastery of St. Gildas-de-Rhuys, in Lower Brittany, on the
lonely, inhospitable shore of the Atlantic. Eager for rest and a position
promising influence, Ab&eacute;lard accepted the offer and left the Paraclete,
not knowing what he was doing.</p>

<p>His position at St. Gildas was little less than slow martyrdom.
The country was wild, the inhabitants were half barbarous, speaking
a language unintelligible to him; the monks were violent, unruly, and
dissolute, openly living with concubines; the lands of the monastery
were subjected to intolerable burdens by the neighboring lord, leaving
the monks in poverty and discontent. Instead of finding a home
of God-fearing men, eager for enlightenment, he found a nest of greed
and corruption. His attempts to introduce discipline, or even decency,
among his &quot;sons,&quot; only stirred up rebellion and placed his life in danger.
Many times he was menaced with the sword, many times with
poison. In spite of all that, he clung to his office, and labored to do
his duty. Meanwhile the jealous abbot of St. Denis succeeded in
establishing a claim to the lands of the convent at Argenteuil,--of
which H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, long since famous not only for learning but also for
saintliness, was now the head,--and she and her nuns were violently
evicted and cast on the world. Hearing of this with indignation,
Ab&eacute;lard at once offered the homeless sisters the deserted Paraclete
and all its belongings. The offer was thankfully accepted, and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se
with her family removed there to spend the remainder of her life.
It does not appear that Ab&eacute;lard and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se ever saw each other at
this time, although he used every means in his power to provide for
her safety and comfort. This was in 1129. Two years later the Paraclete
was confirmed to H&eacute;lo&iuml;se by a Papal bull. It remained a convent,
and a famous one, for over six hundred years.</p>

<p>After this Ab&eacute;lard paid several visits to the convent, which he
justly regarded as his foundation, in order to arrange a rule of life
for its inmates, and to encourage them in their vocation. Although
on these occasions he saw nothing of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, he did not escape the
malignant suspicions of the world, nor of his own flock, which now
became more unruly than ever,--so much so that he was compelled
to live outside the monastery. Excommunication was tried in vain,
and even the efforts of a Papal legate failed to restore order. For
Ab&eacute;lard there was nothing but &quot;fear within and conflict without.&quot;
It was at this time, about 1132, that he wrote his famous 'Historia
Calamitatum,' from which most of the above account of his life has
been taken. In 1134, after nine years of painful struggle, he definitely
left St. Gildas, without, however, resigning the abbotship. For
the next two years he seems to have led a retired life, revising his
old works and composing new ones.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, by some chance, his 'History of Calamities' fell into
the hands of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se at the Paraclete, was devoured with breathless
interest, and rekindled the flame that seemed to have smoldered in
her bosom for thirteen long years. Overcome with compassion for
her husband, for such he really was, she at once wrote to him a letter
which reveals the first healthy human heart-beat that had found
expression in Christendom for a thousand years. Thus began a correspondence
which, for genuine tragic pathos and human interest,
has no equal in the world's literature. In Ab&eacute;lard, the scholarly
monk has completely replaced the man; in H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, the saintly nun
is but a veil assumed in loving obedience to him, to conceal the
deep-hearted, faithful, devoted flesh-and-blood woman. And such a
woman! It may well be doubted if, for all that constitutes genuine
womanhood, she ever had an equal. If there is salvation in love,
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se is in the heaven of heavens. She does not try to express her
love in poems, as Mrs. Browning did; but her simple, straightforward
expression of a love that would share Francesca's fate with her lover,
rather than go to heaven without him, yields, and has yielded,
matter for a hundred poems. She looks forward to no salvation; for
her chief love is for him. <i>Domino specialiter, sua singulariter</i>: &quot;As a
member of the species woman I am the Lord's, as H&eacute;lo&iuml;se I am
yours&quot;--nominalism with a vengeance!</p>

<p>But to return to Ab&eacute;lard. Permanent quiet in obscurity was
plainly impossible for him; and so in 1136 we find him back at Ste.
G&eacute;n&eacute;vi&egrave;ve, lecturing to crowds of enthusiastic students. He probably
thought that during the long years of his exile, the envy and hatred
of his enemies had died out; but he soon discovered that he was
greatly mistaken. He was too marked a character, and the tendency
of his thought too dangerous, for that. Besides, he emptied the
schools of his rivals, and adopted no conciliatory tone toward them.
The natural result followed. In the year 1140, his enemies, headed
by St. Bernard, who had long regarded him with suspicion, raised a
cry of heresy against him, as subjecting everything to reason. Bernard,
who was nothing if not a fanatic, and who managed to give
vent to all his passions by placing them in the service of his God, at
once denounced him to the Pope, to cardinals, and to bishops, in
passionate letters, full of rhetoric, demanding his condemnation as a
perverter of the bases of the faith.</p>

<p>At that time a great ecclesiastical council was about to assemble
at Sens; and Ab&eacute;lard, feeling certain that his writings contained
nothing which he could not show to be strictly orthodox, demanded
that he should be allowed to explain and dialectically defend his
position, in open dispute, before it. But this was above all things
what his enemies dreaded. They felt that nothing was safe before
his brilliant dialectic. Bernard even refused to enter the lists with
him; and preferred to draw up a list of his heresies, in the form of
sentences sundered from their context in his works,--some of them,
indeed, from works which he never wrote,--and to call upon the council
to condemn them. (These theses may be found in Denzinger's
'Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum,' pp. 109 <i>seq.</i>) Ab&eacute;lard,
clearly understanding the scheme, feeling its unfairness, and knowing
the effect of Bernard's lachrymose pulpit rhetoric upon sympathetic
ecclesiastics who believed in his power to work miracles, appeared
before the council, only to appeal from its authority to Rome. The
council, though somewhat disconcerted by this, proceeded to condemn
the disputed theses, and sent a notice of its action to the Pope.
Fearing that Ab&eacute;lard, who had friends in Rome, might proceed
thither and obtain a reversal of the verdict, Bernard set every agency
at work to obtain a confirmation of it before his victim could reach
the Eternal City. And he succeeded.</p>

<p>The result was for a time kept secret from Ab&eacute;lard, who, now
over sixty years old, set out on his painful journey. Stopping on his
way at the famous, hospitable Abbey of Cluny, he was most kindly
entertained by its noble abbot, who well deserved the name of Peter
the Venerable. Here, apparently, he learned that he had been condemned
and excommunicated; for he went no further. Peter offered
the weary man an asylum in his house, which was gladly accepted;
and Ab&eacute;lard, at last convinced of the vanity of all worldly ambition,
settled down to a life of humiliation, meditation, study, and prayer.
Soon afterward Bernard made advances toward reconciliation, which
Ab&eacute;lard accepted; whereupon his excommunication was removed.
Then the once proud Ab&eacute;lard, shattered in body and broken in spirit,
had nothing more to do but to prepare for another life. And the end
was not far off. He died at St. Marcel, on the 21st of April, 1142,
at the age of sixty-three. His generous host, in a letter to H&eacute;lo&iuml;se,
gives a touching account of his closing days, which were mostly
spent in a retreat provided for him on the banks of the Sa&ocirc;ne.
There he read, wrote, dictated, and prayed, in the only quiet days
which his life ever knew.</p>

<p>The body of Ab&eacute;lard was placed in a monolith coffin and buried
in the chapel of the monastery of St. Marcel; but Peter the Venerable
twenty-two years afterward allowed it to be secretly removed,
and carried to the Paraclete, where Ab&eacute;lard had wished to lie. When
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, world-famous for learning, virtue, and saintliness, passed
away, and her body was laid beside his, he opened his arms and
clasped her in close embrace. So says the legend, and who would
not believe it? The united remains of the immortal lovers, after
many vicissitudes, found at last (let us hope), in 1817, a permanent
resting place, in the Parisian cemetery of P&egrave;re Lachaise, having been
placed together in Ab&eacute;lard's monolith coffin. &quot;In death they were
not divided.&quot;</p>

<p>Ab&eacute;lard's character may be summed up in a few words. He was
one of the most brilliant and variously gifted men that ever lived, a
sincere lover of truth and champion of freedom. But unfortunately,
his extraordinary personal beauty and charm of manner made him
the object of so much attention and adulation that he soon became
unable to live without seeing himself mirrored in the admiration
and love of others. Hence his restlessness, irritability, craving for
publicity, fondness for dialectic triumph, and inability to live in
fruitful obscurity; hence, too, his intrigue with H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, his continual
struggles and disappointments, his final humiliation and tragic end.
Not having conquered the world, he cannot claim the crown of the
martyr.</p>

<p>Ab&eacute;lard's works were collected by Cousin, and published in three
4to volumes (Paris, 1836, 1849, 1859). They include, besides the
correspondence with H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, and a number of sermons, hymns, answers
to questions, etc., written for her, the following:--(1) 'Sic et Non,'
a collection of (often contradictory) statements of the Fathers concerning
the chief dogmas of religion, (2) 'Dialectic,' (3) 'On Genera
and Species,' (4) Glosses to Porphyry's 'Introduction,' Aristotle's
'Categories and Interpretation,' and Boethius's 'Topics,' (5) 'Introduction
to Theology,' (6) 'Christian Theology,' (7) 'Commentary on
the Epistle to the Romans,' (9) 'Abstract of Christian Theology,' (10)
'Ethics, or Know Thyself,' (11) 'Dialogue between a Philosopher, a
Jew, and a Christian,' (12) 'On the Intellects,' (12) 'On the Hexameron,'
with a few short and unimportant fragments and tracts.
None of Ab&eacute;lard's numerous poems in the vernacular, in which he
celebrated his love for H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, which he sang ravishingly (for he was
a famous singer), and which at once became widely popular, seem
to have come down to us; but we have a somewhat lengthy poem,
of considerable merit (though of doubtful authenticity), addressed to
his son Astralabius, who grew to manhood, became a cleric, and died,
it seems, as abbot of Hauterive in Switzerland, in 1162.</p>

<p>Of Ab&eacute;lard's philosophy, little need be added to what has been
already said. It is, on the whole, the philosophy of the Middle Age,
with this difference: that he insists upon making theology rational,
and thus may truly be called the founder of modern rationalism, and
the initiator of the struggle against the tyrannic authority of blind
faith. To have been so is his crowning merit, and is one that can
hardly be overestimated. At the same time it must be borne in mind
that he was a loyal son of the Church, and never dreamed of opposing
or undermining her. His greatest originality is in 'Ethics,' in
which, by placing the essence of morality in the intent and not in
the action, he anticipated Kant and much modern speculation.
Here he did admirable work. Ab&eacute;lard founded no school, strictly
speaking; nevertheless, he determined the method and aim of Scholasticism,
and exercised a boundless influence, which is not dead.
Descartes and Kant are his children. Among his immediate disciples
were a pope, twenty-nine cardinals, and more than fifty bishops. His
two greatest pupils were Peter the Lombard, bishop of Paris, and
author of the 'Sentences,' the theological text-book of the schools for
hundreds of years; and Arnold of Brescia, one of the noblest champions
of human liberty, though condemned and banished by the second
Council of the Lateran.</p>

<p>The best biography of Ab&eacute;lard is that by Charles de R&eacute;musat (2
vols., 8vo, Paris, 1845). See also, in English, Wight's 'Abelard and
Eloise' (New York, 1853).</p>

<p>A letter of yours sent to a friend, best beloved, to console him
in affliction, was lately, almost by a chance, put into my
hands. Seeing the superscription, guess how eagerly I
seized it! I had lost the reality; I hoped to draw some comfort
from this faint image of you. But alas!--for I well remember--every
line was written with gall and wormwood.</p>

<p>How you retold our sorrowful history, and dwelt on your incessant
afflictions! Well did you fulfill that promise to your friend,
that, in comparison with your own, his misfortunes should seem
but as trifles. You recalled the persecutions of your masters, the
cruelty of my uncle, and the fierce hostility of your fellow-pupils,
Albericus of Rheims, and Lotulphus of Lombardy--how through
their plottings that glorious book your Theology was burned, and
you confined and disgraced--you went on to the machinations of
the Abbot of St. Denys and of your false brethren of the convent,
and the calumnies of those wretches, Norbert and Bernard,
who envy and hate you. It was even, you say, imputed to you
as an offense to have given the name of Paraclete, contrary to
the common practice, to the Oratory you had founded.</p>

<p>The persecutions of that cruel tyrant of St. Gildas, and of
those execrable monks,--monks out of greed only, whom notwithstanding
you call your children,--which still harass you, close the
miserable history. Nobody could read or hear these things and
not be moved to tears. What then must they mean to me?</p>

<p>We all despair of your life, and our trembling hearts dread to
hear the tidings of your murder. For Christ's sake, who has
thus far protected you,--write to us, as to His handmaids and
yours, every circumstance of your present dangers. I and my
sisters alone remain of all who were your friends. Let us be
sharers of your joys and sorrows. Sympathy brings some relief,
and a load laid on many shoulders is lighter. And write the more
surely, if your letters may be messengers of joy. Whatever message
they bring, at least they will show that you remember us.
You can write to comfort your friend: while you soothe his
wounds, you inflame mine. Heal, I pray you, those you yourself
have made, you who bustle about to cure those for which you are
not responsible. You cultivate a vineyard you did not plant,
which grows nothing. Give heed to what you owe your own.
You who spend so much on the obstinate, consider what you owe
the obedient. You who lavish pains on your enemies, reflect on
what you owe your daughters. And, counting nothing else, think
how you are bound to me! What you owe to all devoted women,
pay to her who is most devoted.</p>

<p>You know better than I how many treatises the holy fathers
of the Church have written for our instruction; how they have
labored to inform, to advise, and to console us. Is my ignorance
to suggest knowledge to the learned Ab&eacute;lard? Long ago, indeed,
your neglect astonished me. Neither religion, nor love of me, nor
the example of the holy fathers, moved you to try to fix my
struggling soul. Never, even when long grief had worn me down,
did you come to see me, or send me one line of comfort,--me, to
whom you were bound by marriage, and who clasp you about with
a measureless love! And for the sake of this love have I no
right to even a thought of yours?</p>

<p>You well know, dearest, how much I lost in losing you, and
that the manner of it put me to double torture. You only can
comfort me. By you I was wounded, and by you I must be
healed. And it is only you on whom the debt rests. I have
obeyed the last tittle of your commands; and if you bade me, I
would sacrifice my soul.</p>

<p>To please you my love gave up the only thing in the universe
it valued--the hope of your presence--and that forever. The
instant I received your commands I quitted the habit of the
world, and denied all the wishes of my nature. I meant to give
up, for your sake, whatever I had once a right to call my own.</p>

<p>God knows it was always you, and you only that I thought of.
I looked for no dowry, no alliance of marriage. And if the name
of wife is holier and more exalted, the name of friend always
remained sweeter to me, or if you would not be angry, a meaner
title; since the more I gave up, the less should I injure your
present renown, and the more deserve your love.</p>

<p>Nor had you yourself forgotten this in that letter which I
recall. You are ready enough to set forth some of the reasons
which I used to you, to persuade you not to fetter your freedom,
but you pass over most of the pleas I made to withhold you from
our ill-fated wedlock. I call God to witness that if Augustus,
ruler of the world, should think me worthy the honor of marriage,
and settle the whole globe on me to rule forever, it would seem
dearer and prouder to me to be called your mistress than his
empress.</p>

<p>Not because a man is rich or powerful is he better: riches
and power may come from luck, constancy is from virtue. <i>I</i>
hold that woman base who weds a rich man rather than a poor
one, and takes a husband for her own gain. Whoever marries
with such a motive--why, she will follow his prosperity rather
than the man, and be willing to sell herself to a richer suitor.</p>

<p>That happiness which others imagine, best beloved, I experienced.
Other women might think their husbands perfect, and be
happy in the idea, but I knew that you were so and the universe
knew the same. What philosopher, what king, could rival your
fame? What village, city, kingdom, was not on fire to see you?
When you appeared in public, who did not run to behold you?
Wives and maidens alike recognized your beauty and grace.
Queens envied H&eacute;lo&iuml;se her Ab&eacute;lard.</p>

<p>Two gifts you had to lead captive the proudest soul, your voice
that made all your teaching a delight, and your singing, which
was like no other. Do you forget those tender songs you wrote
for me, which all the world caught up and sang,--but not like
you,--those songs that kept your name ever floating in the air,
and made me known through many lands, the envy and the scorn
of women?</p>

<p>What gifts of mind, what gifts of person glorified you! Oh,
my loss! Who would change places with me now!</p>

<p>And <i>you</i> know, Abelard, that though I am the great cause
of your misfortunes, I am most innocent. For a consequence is
no part of a crime. Justice weighs not the thing done, but the
intention. And how pure was my intention toward you, you alone
can judge. Judge me! I will submit.</p>

<p>But how happens it, tell me, that since my profession of the
life which you alone determined, I have been so neglected and so
forgotten that you will neither see me nor write to me? Make
me understand it, if you can, or I must tell you what everybody
says: that it was not a pure love like mine that held your heart,
and that your coarser feeling vanished with absence and ill-report.
Would that to me alone this seemed so, best beloved, and not to
all the world! Would that I could hear others excuse you, or
devise excuses myself!</p>

<p>The things I ask ought to seem very small and easy to you.
While I starve for you, do, now and then, by words, bring back
your presence to me! How can you be generous in deeds if you
are so avaricious in words? I have done everything for your
sake. It was not religion that dragged me, a young girl, so fond
of life, so ardent, to the harshness of the convent, but only your
command. If I deserve nothing from you, how vain is my labor!
God will not recompense me, for whose love I have done nothing.</p>

<p>When you resolved to take the vows, I followed,--rather, I
ran before. You had the image of Lot's wife before your eyes;
you feared I might look back, and therefore you deeded <i>me</i> to
God by the sacred vestments and irrevocable vows before you
took them yourself. For this, I own, I grieved, bitterly ashamed
that I could depend on you so little, when I would lead or follow
you straight to perdition. For my soul is always with you and
no longer mine own. And if it is not with you in these last
wretched years, it is nowhere. Do receive it kindly. Oh, if only
you had returned favor for favor, even a little for the much,
words for things! Would, beloved, that your affection would not
take my tenderness and obedience always for granted; that it
might be more anxious! But just because I have poured out all
I have and am, you give me nothing. Remember, oh, remember
how much you owe!</p>

<p>There was a time when people doubted whether I had given
you all my heart, asking nothing. But the end shows how I
began. I have denied myself a life which promised at least peace
and work in the world, only to obey your hard exactions. I have
kept back nothing for myself, except the comfort of pleasing you.
How hard and cruel are you then, when I ask so little and that
little is so easy for you to give!</p>

<p>In the name of God, to whom you are dedicate, send me some
lines of consolation. Help me to learn obedience! When you
wooed me because earthly love was beautiful, you sent me letter
after letter. With your divine singing every street and house
echoed my name! How much more ought you now to persuade
to God her whom then you turned from Him! Heed what I ask;
think what you owe. I have written a long letter, but the ending
shall be short. Farewell, darling!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p><i>To H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, his best beloved Sister in Christ</i>,</p>
<p class="i3"><i>Ab&eacute;lard, her Brother in Him:</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>If, since we resigned the world I have not written to you, it was
because of the high opinion I have ever entertained of your
wisdom and prudence. How could I think that she stood in
need of help on whom Heaven had showered its best gifts? You
were able, I knew, by example as by word, to instruct the ignorant,
to comfort the timid, to kindle the lukewarm.</p>

<p>When prioress of Argenteuil, you practiced all these duties;
and if you give the same attention to your daughters that you
then gave to your sisters, it is enough. All my exhortations would
be needless. But if, in your humility, you think otherwise, and if
my words can avail you anything, tell me on what subjects you
would have me write, and as God shall direct me I will instruct
you. I thank God that the constant dangers to which I am
exposed rouse your sympathies. Thus I may hope, under the
divine protection of your prayers, to see Satan bruised under my
feet.</p>

<p>Therefore I hasten to send you the form of prayer you
beseech of me--you, my sister, once dear to me in the world, but
now far dearer in Christ. Offer to God a constant sacrifice of
prayer. Urge him to pardon our great and manifold sins, and to
avert the dangers which threaten me. We know how powerful
before God and his saints are the prayers of the faithful, but
chiefly of faithful women for their friends, and of wives for their
husbands. The Apostle admonishes us to pray without ceasing.... But
I will not insist on the supplications of your sisterhood,
day and night devoted to the service of their Maker; to
you only do I turn. I well know how powerful your intercession
may be. I pray you, exert it in this my need. In your prayers,
then, ever remember him who, in a special sense, is yours. Urge
your entreaties, for it is just that you should be heard. An equitable
judge cannot refuse it.</p>

<p>In former days, you remember, best beloved, how fervently
you recommended me to the care of Providence. Often in the
day you uttered a special petition. Removed now from the Paraclete,
and surrounded by perils, how much greater my need! Convince
me of the sincerity of your regard, I entreat, I implore you.</p>

<p>[The Prayer:] &quot;O God, who by Thy servant didst here assemble
Thy handmaids in Thy Holy Name, grant, we beseech Thee,
that he be protected from all adversity, and be restored safe to
us, Thy handmaids.&quot;</p>

<p>If Heaven permit my enemies to destroy me, or if I perish by
accident, see that my body is conveyed to the Paraclete. There,
my daughters, or rather my sisters in Christ, seeing my tomb, will
not cease to implore Heaven for me. No resting-place is so safe
for the grieving soul, forsaken in the wilderness of its sins, none
so full of hope as that which is dedicated to the Paraclete--that
is, the Comforter.</p>

<p>Where could a Christian find a more peaceful grave than in
the society of holy women, consecrated by God? They, as the
Gospel tells us, would not leave their divine Master; they embalmed
His body with precious spices; they followed Him to the
tomb, and there they held their vigil. In return, it was to them
that the angel of the resurrection appeared for their consolation.</p>

<p>Finally, let me entreat you that the solicitude you now too
strongly feel for my life you will extend to the repose of my soul.
Carry into my grave the love you showed me when alive; that is,
never forget to pray Heaven for me.</p>

<p>Long life, farewell! Long life, farewell, to your sisters also!
Remember me, but let it be in Christ!</p>

<h2><a name="EDMOND_ABOUT"></a>EDMOND ABOUT</h2>

<h3>(1828-1885)</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-e.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>arly in the reign of Louis Napoleon, a serial story called
'Tolla,' a vivid study of social life in Rome, delighted the
readers of the Revue des Deux Mondes. When published
in book form in 1855 it drew a storm of opprobrium upon its young
author, who was accused of offering as his own creation a translation
of the Italian work 'Vittoria Savorelli.' This charge, undoubtedly
unjust, he indignantly refuted. It served at least to make his name
well known. Another book, 'La Question Romaine,' a brilliant if
somewhat superficial argument against the temporal power of pope
and priests, was a philosophic employment
of the same material. Appearing in 1860,
about the epoch of the French invasion of
Austrian Italy, its tone agreed with popular
sentiment and it was favorably received.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/038.png" width="40%" alt=""></p>

<p>Edmond Fran&ccedil;ois Valentin About had a
freakish, evasive, many-sided personality, a
nature drawn in too many directions to
achieve in any one of these the success his
talents warranted. He was born in Dreuze,
and like most French boys of literary ambition,
soon found his way to Paris, where
he studied at the Lyc&eacute;e Charlemagne. Here
he won the honor prize; and in 1851 was sent to Athens to study
archaeology at the &Eacute;cole Fran&ccedil;aise. He loved change and out-of-the-way
experiences, and two studies resulted from this trip: 'La
Gr&egrave;ce Contemporaine,' a book of charming philosophic description;
and the delightful story 'Le Roi des Montagnes' (The King of the
Mountains). This tale of the long-limbed German student, enveloped
in the smoke from his porcelain pipe as he recounts a series of
impossible adventures,--those of himself and two Englishwomen,
captured for ransom by Hadgi Stavros, brigand king in the Grecian
mountains,--is especially characteristic of About in the humorous
atmosphere of every situation.</p>

<p>About wrote stories so easily and well that his early desertion of
fiction is surprising. His mocking spirit has often suggested comparison
with Voltaire, whom he studied and admired. He too is a skeptic
and an idol-breaker; but his is a kindlier irony, a less incisive
philosophy. Perhaps, however, this influence led to lack of faith in
his own work, to his loss of an ideal, which Zola thinks the real
secret of his sudden change from novelist to journalist. Voltaire
taught him to scoff and disbelieve, to demand &quot;&agrave; quoi bon?&quot; and that
took the heart out of him. He was rather fond of exposing abuses,
a habit that appears in those witty letters to the Gaulois which in
1878 obliged him to suspend that journal. His was a positive mind,
interested in political affairs, and with something always ready to
say upon them. In 1872 he founded a radical newspaper, Le XIXme
Si&egrave;cle (The Nineteenth Century), in association with another aggressive
spirit, that of Francisque Sarcey. For many years he proved his ability
as editor, business man, and keen polemist.</p>

<p>He tried drama, too, inevitable ambition of young French authors;
but after the failure of 'Guillery' at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;aise and
'Ga&eacute;tena' at the Od&eacute;on, renounced the theatre. Indeed, his power
is in odd conceptions, in the covert laugh and humorous suggestion
of the phrasing, rather than in plot or characterization. He will
always be best known for the tales and novels in that thoroughly
French style--clear, concise, and witty--which in 1878 elected him
president of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Gens de Lettres, and in 1884 won him a
seat in the Academy.</p>

<p>About wrote a number of novels, most of them as well known
in translation to English and American readers as to his French
audience. The bright stories originally published in the Moniteur,
afterward collected with the title 'Les Mariages de Paris' had a
conspicuous success, and were followed by a companion volume, 'Les
Mariages de Province.' 'L'Homme &agrave; l'Oreille Cass&eacute;e' (The Man
with the Broken Ear)--the story of a mummy resuscitated to a world
of new conditions after many years of apparent death--shows his
freakish delight in oddity. So does 'Le Nez du Notaire' (The
Notary's Nose), a gruesome tale of the tribulations of a handsome
society man, whose nose is struck off in a duel by a revengeful Turk.
The victim buys a bit of living skin from a poor water-carrier, and
obtains a new nose by successful grafting. But he can nevermore get
rid of the uncongenial Aquarius, who exercises occult influence over
the skin with which he has parted. When he drinks too much, the
Notary's nose is red; when he starves, it dwindles away; when he
loses the arm from which the graft was made, the important feature
drops off altogether, and the sufferer must needs buy a silver one.
About's latest novel, 'Le Roman d'un Brave Homme' (The Story of
an Honest Man), is in quite another vein, a charming picture of
bourgeois virtue in revolutionary days. 'Madelon' and 'La Vielle
Roche' (The Old School) are also popular.</p>

<p>French critics have not found much to say of this non-evolutionist
of letters, who is neither pure realist nor pure romanticist, and who
has no new theory of art. Some, indeed, may have scorned him for
the wise taste which refuses to tread the debatable ground common
to French fiction. But the reading public has received him with less
conscious analysis, and has delighted in him. If he sees only what
any clever man may see, and is no profound psychologist, yet he
tells what he sees and what he imagines with delightful spirit and
delightful wit, and tinges the fabric of his fancy with the ever-changing
colors of his own versatile personality, fanciful suggestions,
homely realism, and bright antithesis. Above all, he has the great
gift of the story-teller.</p>

<br>
<center>From 'The King of the Mountains'</center>
<br>

<p>&quot;ST! ST!&quot;</p>

<p>I raised my eyes. Two thickets of mastic-trees and arbutus
enclosed the road on the right and left. From each tuft
of trees protruded three or four musket-barrels. A voice cried
out in Greek, &quot;Seat yourselves on the ground!&quot; This operation
was the more easy to me, as my legs gave way under me. But I
consoled myself by thinking that Ajax, Agamemnon, and the fiery
Achilles, if they had found themselves in the same situation, would
not have refused the seat that was offered.</p>

<p>The musket-barrels were leveled upon us. It seemed to me
that they stretched out immeasurably, and that their muzzles were
about to join above our heads. It was not that fear disturbed my
vision; but I had never remarked so sensibly the desperate length
of the Greek muskets! The whole arsenal soon debouched into
the road, and every barrel showed its stock and its master.</p>

<p>The only difference which exists between devils and brigands
is, that devils are less black than they are said to be, and brigands
more dirty than people suppose. The eight bullies, who packed
themselves in a circle around us, were so filthy in appearance that
I should have wished to give them my money with a pair of tongs.
You might guess, with a little effort, that their caps had been
red; but lye-wash itself could not have restored the original color
of their clothes. All the rocks of the kingdom had stained their
cotton shirts, and their vests preserved a sample of the different
soils on which they had reposed. Their hands, their faces, and
even their moustachios were of a reddish-gray, like the soil which
supports them. Every animal is colored according to its abode
and its habits: the foxes of Greenland are of the color of snow;
lions, of the desert; partridges, of the furrow; Greek brigands, of
the highway.</p>

<p>The chief of the little troop which had made us prisoners was
distinguished by no outward mark. Perhaps, however, his face,
his hands, and his clothes were richer in dust than those of his
comrades. He leaned toward us from the height of his tall figure,
and examined us so closely that I felt the grazing of his moustachios.
You would have pronounced him a tiger, who smells of
his prey before tasting it. When his curiosity was satisfied, he
said to Dimitri, &quot;Empty your pockets!&quot;</p>

<p>Dimitri did not give him cause to repeat the order: he threw
down before him a knife, a tobacco-pouch, and three Mexican
dollars, which compose a sum of about sixteen francs.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; demanded the brigand.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are the servant?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take back one dollar. You must not return to the city
without money.&quot;</p>

<p>Dimitri haggled. &quot;You could well allow me two,&quot; said he: &quot;I
have two horses below; they are hired from the riding-school; I
shall have to pay for the day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will explain to Zimmerman that we have taken your
money from you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if he wishes to be paid, notwithstanding?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Answer that he is lucky enough to see his horses again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He knows very well that you do not take horses. What
would you do with them in the mountains?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough! What is this big raw-boned animal next you?&quot;</p>

<p>I answered for myself: &quot;An honest German, whose spoils will
not enrich you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak Greek well. Empty your pockets.&quot;</p>

<p>I deposited on the road a score of francs, my tobacco, my
pipe, and my handkerchief.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that?&quot; asked the grand inquisitor.</p>

<p>&quot;A handkerchief.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what purpose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To wipe my nose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you tell me that you were poor? It is only milords
who wipe their noses with handkerchiefs. Take off the box which
you have behind your back. Good! Open it!&quot;</p>

<p>My box contained some plants, a book, a knife, a little package
of arsenic, a gourd nearly empty, and the remnants of my
breakfast, which kindled a look of covetousness in the eyes of
Mrs. Simons. I had the assurance to offer them to her before my
baggage changed masters. She accepted greedily, and began to
devour the bread and meat. To my great astonishment, this act
of gluttony scandalized our robbers, who murmured among themselves
the word &quot;Schismatic:&quot; The monk made half a dozen
signs of the cross, according to the rite of the Greek Church.</p>

<p>&quot;You must have a watch,&quot; said the brigand: &quot;put it with the
rest.&quot;</p>

<p>I gave up my silver watch, a hereditary toy of the weight
of four ounces. The villains passed it from hand to hand, and
thought it very beautiful. I was in hopes that admiration, which
makes men better, would dispose them to restore me something,
and I begged their chief to let me have my tin box. He imposed
silence upon me roughly. &quot;At least,&quot; said I, &quot;give me back two
crowns for my return to the city!&quot; He answered with a sardonic
smile, &quot;You will not have need of them.&quot;</p>

<p>The turn of Mrs. Simons had come. Before putting her hand
in her pocket, she warned our conquerors in the language of her
fathers. The English is one of those rare idioms which one can
speak with a mouth full. &quot;Reflect well on what you are going to
do,&quot; said she, in a menacing tone. &quot;I am an Englishwoman, and
English subjects are inviolable in all the countries of the world.
What you will take from me will serve you little, and will cost
you dear. England will avenge me, and you will all be hanged,
to say the least. Now if you wish my money, you have only to
speak; but it will burn your fingers: it is English money!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does she say?&quot; asked the spokesman of the brigands.</p>

<p>Dimitri answered, &quot;She says that she is English.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So much the better! All the English are rich. Tell her to
do as you have done.&quot;</p>

<p>The poor lady emptied on the sand a purse, which contained
twelve sovereigns. As her watch was not in sight, and as they
made no show of searching us, she kept it. The clemency of the
conquerors left her her pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>Mary Ann threw down her watch, with a whole bunch of
charms against the evil eye. She cast before her, by a movement
full of mute grace, a shagreen bag, which she carried in her belt.
The brigand opened it with the eagerness of a custom-house
officer. He drew from it a little English dressing-case, a vial of
English salts, a box of pastilles of English mint, and a hundred
and some odd francs in English money.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said the impatient beauty, &quot;you can let us go: we
have nothing more for you.&quot; They indicated to her, by a menacing
gesture, that the session was not ended. The chief of the
band squatted down before our spoils, called &quot;the good old man,&quot;
counted the money in his presence, and delivered to him the sum
of forty-five francs. Mrs. Simons nudged me on the elbow. &quot;You
see,&quot; said she, &quot;the monk and Dimitri have betrayed us: he is
dividing the spoils with them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, madam,&quot; replied I, immediately. &quot;Dimitri has received
a mere pittance from that which they had stolen from him. It is
a thing which is done everywhere. On the banks of the Rhine,
when a traveler is ruined at roulette, the conductor of the game
gives him something wherewith to return home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the monk?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has received a tenth part of the booty in virtue of an
immemorial custom. Do not reproach him, but rather be thankful
to him for having wished to save us, when his convent was
interested in our capture.&quot;</p>

<p>This discussion was interrupted by the farewells of Dimitri.
They had just set him at liberty.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait for me,&quot; said I to him: &quot;we will return together.&quot; He
shook his head sadly, and answered me in English, so as to be
understood by the ladies:--
&quot;You are prisoners for some days, and you will not see Athens
again before paying a ransom. I am going to inform the
milord. Have these ladies any messages to give me for him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell him,&quot; cried Mrs. Simons, &quot;to run to the embassy, to
go then to the Piraeus and find the admiral, to complain at the
foreign office, to write to Lord Palmerston! They shall take us
away from here by force of arms, or by public authority, but I
do not intend that they shall disburse a penny for my liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As for me,&quot; replied I, without so much passion, &quot;I beg you
to tell my friends in what hands you have left me. If some hundreds
of drachms are necessary to ransom a poor devil of a naturalist,
they will find them without trouble. These gentlemen of
the highway cannot rate me very high. I have a mind, while
you are still here, to ask them what I am worth at the lowest
price.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would be useless, my dear Mr. Hermann! It is not they
who fix the figures of your ransom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Their chief, Hadgi-Stavros.&quot;</p>



<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>
<center><a name="HADGI-STAVROS"></a>HADGI-STAVROS</center>
<br>
<center>From 'The King of the Mountains'</center>
<br>

<p>The camp of the King was a plateau, covering a surface of
seven or eight hundred metres. I looked in vain for the
tents of our conquerors. The brigands are not sybarites,
and they sleep under the open sky on the 30th of April. I saw
neither spoils heaped up nor treasures displayed, nor any of those
things which one expects to find at the headquarters of a band
of robbers. Hadgi-Stavros makes it his business to have the
booty sold; every man receives his pay in money, and employs it
as he chooses. Some make investments in commerce, others take
mortgages on houses in Athens, others buy land in their villages;
no one squanders the products of robbery. Our arrival interrupted
the breakfast of twenty-five or thirty men, who flocked
around us with their bread and cheese. The chief supports his
soldiers; there is distributed to them every day one ration of
bread, oil, wine, cheese, caviare, allspice, bitter olives, and meat
when their religion permits it. The epicures who wish to eat
mallows or other herbs are at liberty to gather delicacies in the
mountains.</p>

<p>The office of the King was as much like an office as the camp
of the robbers was like a camp. Neither tables nor chairs nor
movables of any sort were to be seen there. Hadgi-Stavros was
seated cross-legged on a square carpet in the shade of a fir-tree.
Four secretaries and two servants were grouped around him. A
boy of sixteen or eighteen was occupied incessantly in filling,
lighting, and cleaning the chibouk of his master. He carried in
his belt a tobacco-pouch, embroidered with gold and fine mother-of-pearl,
and a pair of silver pincers intended for taking up coals.
Another servant passed the day in preparing cups of coffee,
glasses of water, and sweetmeats to refresh the royal mouth. The
secretaries, seated on the bare rock, wrote on their knees, with
pens made of reeds. Each of them had at hand a long copper
box containing reeds, penknife, and inkhorn. Some tin cylinders,
like those in which our soldiers roll up their discharges, served
as a depository for the archives. The paper was not of native
manufacture, and for a good reason, Every leaf bore the word
BATH in capital letters.</p>

<p>The King was a fine old man, marvelously well preserved,
straight, slim, supple as a spring, spruce and shining as a new
sabre. His long white moustachios hung under his chin like two
marble stalactites. The rest of his face was carefully shaved, the
skull bare even to the occiput, where a long tress of white hair
was rolled up under his hat. The expression of his features appeared
to me calm and thoughtful. A pair of small, clear blue
eyes and a square chin announced an indomitable will. His face
was long, and the position of the wrinkles lengthened it still more.
All the creases of the forehead were broken in the middle, and
seemed to direct themselves toward the meeting of the eyebrows;
two wide and deep furrows descended perpendicularly to the
corners of the lips, as if the weight of the moustachios had
drawn in the muscles of the face.</p>

<p>I have seen a good many septuagenarians; I have even dissected
one who would have reached a hundred years, if the diligence
of Osnabr&uuml;ck had not passed over his body: but I do not
remember to have observed a more green and robust old age
than that of Hadgi-Stavros. He wore the dress of Tino and of
all the islands of the Archipelago. His red cap formed a large
crease at its base around his forehead. He had a vest of black
cloth, faced with black silk, immense blue pantaloons which contained
more than twenty metres of cotton cloth, and great boots
of Russia leather, elastic and stout. The only rich thing in his
costume was a scarf embroidered with gold and precious stones,
which might be worth two or three thousand francs. It inclosed
in its folds an embroidered cashmere purse, a Damascus sanjar
in a silver sheath, a long pistol mounted in gold and rubies, and
the appropriate baton.</p>

<p>Quietly seated in the midst of his employees, Hadgi-Stavros
moved only the ends of his fingers and his lips; the lips to dictate
his correspondence, the fingers to count the beads in his
chaplet. It was one of those beautiful chaplets of milky amber
which do not serve to number prayers, but to amuse the solemn
idleness of the Turk.</p>

<p>He raised his head at our approach, guessed at a glance the
occurrence which had brought us there, and said to us, with a
gravity which had in it nothing ironical, &quot;You are welcome! Be
seated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; cried Mrs. Simons, &quot;I am an Englishwoman, and--&quot;
He interrupted the discourse by making his tongue smack against
the teeth of his upper jaw--superb teeth, indeed! &quot;Presently,&quot;
said he: &quot;I am occupied.&quot; He understood only Greek, and Mrs.
Simons knew only English; but the physiognomy of the King was
so speaking that the good lady comprehended easily without the
aid of an interpreter.</p>

<br>

<p>L&eacute;on took his bunch of keys and opened the long oak box on
which he had been seated. The lid being raised, they saw
a great leaden casket which inclosed a magnificent walnut
box carefully polished on the outside, lined on the inside with
white silk, and padded.</p>

<p>The others brought their lamps and candles near, and the
colonel of the Twenty-third of the line appeared as if he were in
a chapel illuminated for his lying in state.</p>

<p>One would have said that the man was asleep. The perfect
preservation of the body attested the paternal care of the murderer.
It was truly a remarkable preparation, and would have
borne comparison with the finest European mummies described by
Vicq d'Azyr in 1779, and by the younger Puymaurin in 1787. The
part best preserved, as is always the case, was the face. All the
features had maintained a proud and manly expression. If any
old friend of the colonel had been at the opening of the third
box, he would have recognized him at first sight. Undoubtedly
the point of the nose was a little sharper, the nostrils less expanded
and thinner, and the bridge a little more marked, than in
the year 1813. The eyelids were thinned, the lips pinched, the
corners of the mouth drawn down, the cheek bones too prominent,
and the neck visibly shrunken, which exaggerated the prominence
of the chin and larynx. But the eyelids were closed without
contraction, and the sockets much less hollow than one could
have expected; the mouth was not at all distorted, like the mouth
of a corpse; the skin was slightly wrinkled, but had not changed
color,--it had only become a little more transparent, showing
after a fashion the color of the tendons, the fat, and the muscles,
wherever it rested directly upon them. It also had a rosy tint
which is not ordinarily seen in embalmed corpses. Dr. Martout
explained this anomaly by saying that if the colonel had actually
been dried alive, the globules of the blood were not decomposed,
but simply collected in the capillary vessels of the skin and subjacent
tissues, where they still preserved their proper color, and
could be seen more easily than otherwise on account of the
semi-transparency of the skin.</p>

<p>The uniform had become much too large, as may be readily
understood, though it did not seem at a casual glance that the
members had become deformed. The hands were dry and angular,
but the nails, although a little bent inward toward the root,
had preserved all their freshness. The only very noticeable
change was the excessive depression of the abdominal walls, which
seemed crowded downward to the posterior side; at the right, a
slight elevation indicated the place of the liver. A tap of the
finger on the various parts of the body produced a sound like
that from dry leather. While L&eacute;on was pointing out these details
to his audience and doing the honors of his mummy, he awkwardly
broke off the lower part of the right ear, and a little
piece of the colonel remained in his hand. This trifling accident
might have passed unnoticed had not Cl&eacute;mentine, who followed
with visible emotion all the movements of her lover, dropped her
candle and uttered a cry of affright. All gathered around her.
L&eacute;on took her in his arms and carried her to a chair. M. Renault
ran after salts. She was as pale as death, and seemed on
the point of fainting. She soon recovered, however, and reassured
them all by a charming smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me,&quot; she said, &quot;for such a ridiculous exhibition of
terror; but what Monsieur L&eacute;on was saying to us--and then--that
figure which seemed sleeping--it appeared to me that the
poor man was going to open his mouth and cry out, when he
was injured.&quot;</p>

<p>L&eacute;on hastened to close the walnut box, while M. Martout
picked up the piece of ear and put it in his pocket. But Cl&eacute;mentine,
while continuing to smile and make apologies, was
overcome by a fresh access of emotion and melted into tears.
The engineer threw himself at her feet, poured forth excuses
and tender phrases, and did all he could to console her inexplicable
grief.</p>

<p>Cl&eacute;mentine dried her eyes, looked prettier than ever, and
sighed fit to break her heart, without knowing why.</p>

<p>&quot;Beast that I am!&quot; muttered L&eacute;on, tearing his hair. &quot;On the
day when I see her again after three years' absence, I can think
of nothing more soul-inspiring than showing her mummies!&quot; He
launched a kick at the triple coffin of the colonel, saying, &quot;I wish
the devil had the confounded colonel!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; cried Cl&eacute;mentine, with redoubled energy and emotion.
&quot;Do not curse him, Monsieur L&eacute;on! He has suffered so much!
Ah! poor, poor, unfortunate man!&quot;</p>

<p>Mlle. Sambucco felt a little ashamed. She made excuses for
her niece, and declared that never, since her tenderest childhood,
had she manifested such extreme sensitiveness ... Cl&eacute;mentine
was no sensitive plant. She was not even a romantic school-girl.
Her youth had not been nourished by Anne Radcliffe, she
did not trouble herself about ghosts, and she would go through the
house very tranquilly at ten o'clock at night without a candle.
When her mother died, some months before L&eacute;on's departure, she
did not wish to have any one share with her the sad satisfaction
of watching and praying in the death chamber.</p>

<p>&quot;This will teach us,&quot; said the aunt, &quot;what staying up after
ten o'clock does. What! it is midnight, within a quarter of an
hour! Come, my child; you will recover fast enough after you
get to bed.&quot;</p>

<p>Cl&eacute;mentine arose submissively; but at the moment of leaving
the laboratory she retraced her steps, and with a caprice more
inexplicable than her grief, she absolutely demanded to see the
mummy of the colonel again. Her aunt scolded in vain; in spite
of the remarks of Mlle. Sambucco and all the others present, she
reopened the walnut box, knelt down beside the mummy, and
kissed it on the forehead.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor man!&quot; said she, rising. &quot;How cold he is! Monsieur
L&eacute;on, promise me that if he is dead you will have him laid in
consecrated ground!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you please, mademoiselle. I intended to send him to the
anthropological museum, with my father's permission; but you
know that we can refuse you nothing.&quot;</p>

<br>

<p>Forthwith the colonel marched and opened the windows with
a precipitation which upset the gazers among the crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;People,&quot; said he, &quot;I have knocked down a hundred beggarly
pandours, who respect neither sex nor infirmity. For the benefit
of those who are not satisfied, I will state that I call myself
Colonel Fougas of the Twenty-third. And <i>Vive l'Emp&eacute;reur!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>A confused mixture of plaudits, cries, laughs, and jeers answered
this unprecedented allocution. L&eacute;on Renault hastened out
to make apologies to all to whom they were due. He invited a
few friends to dine the same evening with the terrible colonel,
and of course he did not forget to send a special messenger to
Cl&eacute;mentine. Fougas, after speaking to the people, returned to his
hosts, swinging himself along with a swaggering air, set himself
astride a chair, took hold of the ends of his mustache, and said:--</p>

<p>&quot;Well! Come, let's talk this over. I've been sick, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very sick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's incredible! I feel entirely well; I'm hungry; and moreover,
while waiting for dinner I'll try a glass of your schnick.&quot;</p>

<p>Mme. Renault went out, gave an order, and returned in an
instant.</p>

<p>&quot;But tell me, then, where I am?&quot; resumed the colonel. &quot;By
these paraphernalia of work, I recognize a disciple of Urania; possibly
a friend of Monge and Berthollet. But the cordial friendliness
impressed on your countenances proves to me that you are
not natives of this land of sauerkraut. Yes, I believe it from the
beatings of my heart. Friends, we have the same fatherland.
The kindness of your reception, even were there no other indications,
would have satisfied me that you are French. What accidents
have brought you so far from our native soil? Children of
my country, what tempest has thrown you upon this inhospitable
shore?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear colonel,&quot; replied M. Nibor, &quot;if you want to become
very wise, you will not ask so many questions at once. Allow us
the pleasure of instructing you quietly and in order, for you have
a great many things to learn.&quot;</p>

<p>The colonel flushed with anger, and answered sharply:--</p>

<p>&quot;At all events, you are not the man to teach them to me, my
little gentleman!&quot;</p>

<p>A drop of blood which fell on his hand changed the current of
his thoughts.</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; said he: &quot;am I bleeding?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That will amount to nothing: circulation is re-established,
and--and your broken ear--&quot;</p>

<p>He quickly carried his hand to his ear, and said:--</p>

<p>&quot;It's certainly so. But devil take me if I recollect this accident!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll make you a little dressing, and in a couple of days there
will be no trace of it left.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't give yourself the trouble, my dear Hippocrates: a pinch
of powder is a sovereign cure!&quot;</p>

<p>M. Nibor set to work to dress the ear in a little less military
fashion. During his operations L&eacute;on re-entered.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; said he to the doctor: &quot;you are repairing the harm
I did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thunderation!&quot; cried Fougas, escaping from the hands of
M. Nibor so as to seize L&eacute;on by the collar, &quot;was it you, you
rascal, that hurt my ear?&quot;</p>

<p>L&eacute;on was very good-natured, but his patience failed him. He
pushed his man roughly aside.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir: it was I who tore your ear, in pulling it; and if
that little misfortune had not happened to me, it is certain that
you would have been to-day six feet under ground. It is I who
saved your life, after buying you with my money when you were
not valued at more than twenty-five louis. It is I who have
passed three days and two nights in cramming charcoal under
your boiler. It is my father who gave you the clothes you now
have on. You are in our house. Drink the little glass of brandy
Gothon just brought you; but for God's sake give up the habit
of calling me rascal, of calling my mother 'Good Mother,' and
of flinging our friends into the street and calling them beggarly
pandours!&quot;</p>

<p>The colonel, all dumbfounded, held out his hand to L&eacute;on, M.
Renault, and the doctor, gallantly kissed the hand of Mme.
Renault, swallowed at a gulp a claret glass filled to the brim with
brandy, and said, in a subdued voice:--</p>

<p>&quot;Most excellent friends, forget the vagaries of an impulsive
but generous soul. To subdue my passions shall hereafter be my
law. After conquering all the nations in the universe, it is well
to conquer one's self.&quot;</p>

<p>This said, he submitted his ear to M. Nibor, who finished
dressing it.</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; said he, summoning up his recollections, &quot;they did not
shoot me, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I wasn't frozen to death in the tower?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not quite.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why has my uniform been taken off? I see! I am a prisoner!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are free.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Free! <i>Vive l'Emp&eacute;reur!</i> But then there's not a moment to
lose! How many leagues is it to Dantzic?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's very far.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you call this chicken-coop of a town?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fontainebleau.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fontainebleau! In France?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Prefecture of Seine-et-Marne. We are going to introduce
to you the sub-pr&eacute;fect, whom you just pitched into the street.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the devil are your sub-prefects to me? I have a
message from the Emperor to General Rapp, and I must start
this very day for Dantzic. God knows whether I'll be there in
time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My poor colonel, you will arrive too late. Dantzic is given
up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's impossible! Since when?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About forty-six years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thunder! I did not understand that you were--mocking
me!&quot;</p>

<p>M. Nibor placed in his hand a calendar, and said, &quot;See for
yourself! It is now the 17th of August, 1859; you went to sleep
in the tower of Liebenfeld on the 11th of November, 1813: there
have been, then, forty-six years, within three months, during
which the world has moved on without you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty-four and forty-six: but then I would be seventy years
old, according to your statement!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your vitality clearly shows that you are still twenty-four.&quot;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, tore up the calendar, and said,
beating the floor with his foot, &quot;Your almanac is a humbug!&quot;</p>

<p>M. Renault ran to his library, took up half a dozen books at
haphazard, and made him read, at the foot of the title-pages, the
dates 1826, 1833, 1847, and 1858.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said Fougas, burying his head in his hands.
&quot;What has happened to me is so new! I do not think that
another human being was ever subjected to such a trial. I am
seventy years old!&quot;</p>

<p>Good Mme. Renault went and got a looking-glass from the
bath-room and gave it to him, saying:--</p>

<p>&quot;Look!&quot;</p>

<p>He took the glass in both hands, and was silently occupied in
resuming acquaintance with himself, when a hand-organ came into
the court and began playing 'Partant pour la Syrie.'</p>

<p>Fougas threw the mirror to the ground, and cried out:--</p>

<p>&quot;What is that you are telling me? I hear the little song of
Queen Hortense!&quot;</p>

<p>M. Renault patiently explained to him, while picking up the
pieces of the mirror, that the pretty little song of Queen Hortense
had become a national air, and even an official one, since
the regimental bands had substituted that gentle melody for the
fierce 'Marseillaise'; and that our soldiers, strange to say, had
not fought any the worse for it. But the colonel had already
opened the window, and was crying out to the Savoyard with the
organ:--</p>

<p>&quot;Eh! Friend! A napoleon for you if you will tell me in
what year I am drawing the breath of life!&quot;</p>

<p>The artist began dancing as lightly as possible, playing on his
musical instrument.</p>

<p>&quot;Advance at the order!&quot; cried the colonel, &quot;and keep that
devilish machine still!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little penny, my good monsieur!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not a penny that I'll give you, but a napoleon, if you'll
tell what year it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but that's funny! Hi--hi--hi!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if you don't tell me quicker than this amounts to, I'll
cut your ears off!&quot;</p>

<p>The Savoyard ran away, but he came back pretty soon, having
meditated, during his flight, on the maxim &quot;Nothing risk, nothing
gain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he, in a wheedling voice, &quot;this is the year
eighteen hundred and fifty-nine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good!&quot; cried Fougas. He felt in his pockets for money, and
found nothing there. L&eacute;on saw his predicament, and flung twenty
francs into the court. Before shutting the window, he pointed
out, to the right, the fa&ccedil;ade of a pretty little new building, where
the colonel could distinctly read:--</p>

<blockquote>AUDRET ARCHITECTE<br>
MDCCCLIX</blockquote>

<p>A perfectly satisfactory piece of evidence, and one which did
not cost twenty francs.</p>

<p>Fougas, a little confused, pressed L&eacute;on's hand and said to
him:--</p>

<p>&quot;My friend, I do not forget that Confidence is the first duty
from Gratitude toward Beneficence. But tell me of our country!
I tread the sacred soil where I received my being, and I am
ignorant of the career of my native land. France is still the
queen of the world, is she not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said L&eacute;on.</p>

<p>&quot;How is the Emperor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the Empress?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the King of Rome?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Prince Imperial? He is a very fine child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How? A fine child! And you have the face to say that this
is 1859!&quot;</p>

<p>M. Nibor took up the conversation, and explained in a few
words that the reigning sovereign of France was not Napoleon I.,
but Napoleon III.</p>

<p>&quot;But then,&quot; cried Fougas, &quot;my Emperor is dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible! Tell me anything you will but that! My Emperor
is immortal.&quot;</p>

<p>M. Nibor and the Renaults, who were not quite professional
historians, were obliged to give him a summary of the history of
our century. Some one went after a big book, written by M. de
Norvins and illustrated with fine engravings by Raffet. He only
believed in the presence of Truth when he could touch her with
his hand, and still cried out almost every moment, &quot;That's impossible!
This is not history that you are reading to me: it is a
romance written to make soldiers weep!&quot;</p>

<p>This young man must indeed have had a strong and well-tempered
soul; for he learned in forty minutes all the woful events
which fortune had scattered through eighteen years, from the first
abdication up to the death of the King of Rome. Less happy
than his old companions in arms, he had no interval of repose
between these terrible and repeated shocks, all beating upon his
heart at the same time. One could have feared that the blow
might prove mortal, and poor Fougas die in the first hour of his
recovered life. But the imp of a fellow yielded and recovered
himself in quick succession like a spring. He cried out with
admiration on hearing of the five battles of the campaign in
France; he reddened with grief at the farewells of Fontainebleau.
The return from the Isle of Elba transfigured his handsome and
noble countenance; at Waterloo his heart rushed in with the last
army of the Empire, and there shattered itself. Then he clenched
his fists and said between his teeth, &quot;If I had been there at the
head of the Twenty-Third, Bl&uuml;cher and Wellington would have
seen another fate!&quot; The invasion, the truce, the martyr of St.
Helena, the ghastly terror of Europe, the murder of Murat,--the
idol of the cavalry,--the deaths of Ney, Bruno, Mouton-Duvernet,
and so many other whole-souled men whom he had known, admired,
and loved, threw him into a series of paroxysms of rage;
but nothing crushed him. In hearing of the death of Napoleon,
he swore that he would eat the heart of England; the slow agony
of the pale and interesting heir of the Empire inspired him with
a passion to tear the vitals out of Austria. When the drama was
over, and the curtain fell on Sch&ouml;nbrunn, he dashed away his
tears and said, &quot;It is well. I have lived in a moment a man's
entire life. Now show me the map of France!&quot;</p>

<p>L&eacute;on began to turn over the leaves of an atlas, while M.
Renault attempted to continue narrating to the colonel the history
of the Restoration, and of the monarchy of 1830. But Fougas's
interest was in other things.</p>

<p>&quot;What do I care,&quot; said he, &quot;if a couple of hundred babblers
of deputies put one king in place of another? Kings! I've seen
enough of them in the dirt. If the Empire had lasted ten years
longer, I could have had a king for a bootblack.&quot;</p>

<p>When the atlas was placed before him, he at once cried out
with profound disdain, &quot;That France?&quot; But soon two tears of
pitying affection, escaping from his eyes, swelled the rivers
Ard&egrave;che and Gironde. He kissed the map and said, with an
emotion which communicated itself to nearly all those who were
present:--</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me, poor old love, for insulting your misfortunes.
Those scoundrels whom we always whipped have profited by my
sleep to pare down your frontiers; but little or great, rich or poor,
you are my mother, and I love you as a faithful son! Here is
Corsica, where the giant of our age was born; here is Toulouse,
where I first saw the light; here is Nancy, where I felt my heart
awakened--where, perhaps, she whom I call my Aegl&eacute; waits for
me still! France! Thou hast a temple in my soul; this arm is
thine; thou shalt find me ever ready to shed my blood to the last
drop in defending or avenging thee!&quot;</p>

<h3>BY CRAWFORD H. TOY</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-r.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ecent discoveries have carried the beginnings of civilization
farther and farther back into the remote past. Scholars are
not agreed as to what region can lay claim to the greatest
literary antiquity. The oldest historical records are found in Egypt
and Babylonia, and each of these lands has its advocates, who claim
for it priority in culture. The data now at our command are not sufficient
for the decision of this question. It may be doubted whether
any one spot on the globe will ever be shown to have precedence in
time over all others,--whether, that is, it will appear that the
civilization of the world has proceeded from a single centre. But though
we are yet far from having reached the very beginnings of culture,
we know that they lie farther back than the wildest dreams of half a
century ago would have imagined. Established kingdoms existed in
Babylonia in the fourth millennium before the beginning of our era;
royal inscriptions have been found which are with great probability
assigned to about the year 3800 B.C. These are, it is true, of the
simplest description, consisting of a few sentences of praise to a deity
or brief notices of a campaign or of the building of a temple; but
they show that the art of writing was known, and that the custom
existed of recording events of the national history. We may thence
infer the existence of a settled civilization and of some sort of literary
productiveness.</p>

<p>The Babylonian-Assyrian writings with which we are acquainted
may be divided into the two classes of prose and poetry. The former
class consists of royal inscriptions (relating to military campaigns and
the construction of temples), chronological tables (eponym canons),
legal documents (sales, suits, etc.), grammatical tables (paradigms and
vocabularies), lists of omens and lucky and unlucky days, and letters
and reports passing between kings and governors; the latter class
includes cosmogonic poems, an epic poem in twelve books, detached
mythical narratives, magic formulas and incantations, and prayers to
deities (belonging to the ritual service of the temples). The prose
pieces, with scarcely an exception, belong to the historical period, and
may be dated with something like accuracy. The same thing is true
of a part of the poetical material, particularly the prayers; but the
cosmogonic and other mythical poems appear to go back, at least so
far as their material is concerned, to a very remote antiquity, and it
is difficult to assign them a definite date.</p>

<p>Whether this oldest poetical material belongs to the Semitic Babylonians
or to a non-Semitic (Sumerian-Accadian) people is a question
not yet definitely decided. The material which comes into consideration
for the solution of this problem is mainly linguistic. Along
with the inscriptions, which are obviously in the Semitic-Babylonian
language, are found others composed of words apparently strange.
These are held by some scholars to represent a priestly, cryptographic
writing, by others to be true Semitic words in slightly altered form,
and by others still to belong to a non-Semitic tongue. This last view
supposes that the ancient poetry comes, in substance at any rate,
from a non-Semitic people who spoke this tongue; while on the other
hand, it is maintained that this poetry is so interwoven into Semitic
life that it is impossible to regard it as of foreign origin. The
majority of Semitic scholars are now of the opinion that the origin
of this early literature is foreign. However this may be, it comes to
us in Babylonian dress, it has been elaborated by Babylonian hands,
has thence found its way into the literature of other Semitic peoples,
and for our purposes may be accepted as Babylonian. In any case it
carries us back to very early religious conceptions.</p>

<p>The cosmogonic poetry is in its outlines not unlike that of Hesiod,
but develops the ruder ideas at greater length. In the shortest (but
probably not the earliest) form of the cosmogony, the beginning of
all things is found in the watery abyss. Two abysmal powers
(Tiamat and Apsu), represented as female and male, mingle their
waters, and from them proceed the gods. The list of deities (as in
the Greek cosmogony) seems to represent several dynasties, a conception
which may embody the belief in the gradual organization of the
world. After two less-known gods, called Lahmu and Lahamu, come
the more familiar figures of later Babylonian writing, Anu and Ea. At
this point the list unfortunately breaks off, and the creative function
which may have been assigned to the gods is lost, or has not yet
been discovered. The general similarity between this account and
that of Gen. i. is obvious: both begin with the abysmal chaos. Other
agreements between the two cosmogonies will be pointed out below.
The most interesting figure in this fragment is that of Tiamat. We
shall presently see her in the character of the enemy of the gods.
The two conceptions of her do not agree together perfectly, and the
priority in time must be assigned to the latter. The idea that the
world of gods and men and material things issued out of the womb
of the abyss is a philosophic generalization that is more naturally
assigned to a period of reflection.</p>

<p>In the second cosmogonic poem the account is more similar to that
of the second chapter of Genesis, and its present form originated in
or near Babylon. Here we have nothing of the primeval deep, but
are told how the gods made a beautiful land, with rivers and trees;
how Babylon was built and Marduk created man, and the Tigris and
the Euphrates, and the beasts and cities and temples. This also must
be looked on as a comparatively late form of the myth, since its hero
is Marduk, god of Babylon. As in the Bible account, men are created
before beasts, and the region of their first abode seems to be the same
as the Eden of Genesis.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the poem in which the combat between Tiamat
and Marduk forms the principal feature. For some unexplained
reason Tiamat rebels against the gods. Collecting her hosts, among
them frightful demon shapes of all imaginable forms, she advances
for the purpose of expelling the gods from their seats. The affrighted
deities turn for protection to the high gods, Anu and Ea, who, however,
recoil in terror from the hosts of the dragon Tiamat. Anshar
then applies to Marduk. The gods are invited to a feast, the situation
is described, and Marduk is invited to lead the heavenly hosts
against the foe. He agrees on condition that he shall be clothed
with absolute power, so that he shall only have to say &quot;Let it be,&quot;
and it shall be. To this the gods assent: a garment is placed before
him, to which he says &quot;Vanish,&quot; and it vanishes, and when he commands
it to appear, it is present. The hero then dons his armor and
advances against the enemy. He takes Tiamat and slays her, routs
her host, kills her consort Kingu, and utterly destroys the rebellion.
Tiamat he cuts in twain. Out of one half of her he forms the
heavens, out of the other half the earth, and for the gods Anu and
Bel and Ea he makes a heavenly palace, like the abyss itself in
extent. To the great gods also he assigns positions, forms the stars,
establishes the year and month and the day. At this point the history
is interrupted, the tablet being broken. The creation of the
heavenly bodies is to be compared with the similar account in
Gen. i.; whether this poem narrates the creation of the rest of the
world it is impossible to say.</p>

<p>In this history of the rebellion of Tiamat against the gods we have
a mythical picture of some natural phenomenon, perhaps of the conflict
between the winter and the enlivening sun of summer. The
poem appears to contain elements of different dates. The rude character
of some of the procedures suggests an early time: Marduk slays
Tiamat by driving the wind into her body; the warriors who accompany
her have those composite forms familiar to us from Babylonian
and Egyptian statues, paintings, and seals, which are the product
of that early thought for which there was no essential difference
between man and beast. The festival in which the gods carouse is
of a piece with the divine Ethiopian feasts of Homer. On the other
hand, the idea of the omnipotence of the divine word, when Marduk
makes the garment disappear and reappear, is scarcely a primitive
one. It is substantially identical with the Biblical &quot;Let it be, and it
was.&quot; It is probable that the poem had a long career, and in successive
recensions received the coloring of different generations. Tiamat
herself has a long history. Here she is a dragon who assaults the
gods; elsewhere, as we have seen, she is the mother of the gods;
here also her body forms the heaven and the earth. She appears in
Gen. i. 2 as the Tehom, the primeval abyss. In the form of the
hostile dragon she is found in numerous passages of the Old Testament,
though under different names. She is an enemy of Yahwe,
god of Israel, and in the New Testament (Rev. xii.) the combat
between Marduk and Tiamat is represented under the form of a fight
between Michael and the Dragon. In Christian literature Michael has
been replaced by St. George. The old Babylonian conception has been
fruitful of poetry, representing, as it does, in grand form the struggle
between the chaotic and the formative forces of the universe.</p>

<p>The most considerable of the old Babylonian poems, so far as
length and literary form are concerned, is that which has been commonly
known as the Izdubar epic. The form of the name is not
certain: Mr. Pinches has recently proposed, on the authority of a
Babylonian text, to write it Gilgamesh, and this form has been
adopted by a number of scholars. The poem (discovered by George
Smith in 1872) is inscribed on twelve tablets, each tablet apparently
containing a separate episode.</p>

<p>The first tablet introduces the hero as the deliverer of his country
from the Elamites, an event which seems to have taken place before
2000 B.C. Of the second, third, fourth, and fifth tablets, only fragments
exist, but it appears that Gilgamesh slays the Elamite tyrant.</p>

<p>The sixth tablet recounts the love of Ishtar for the hero, to whom
she proposes marriage, offering him the tribute of the land. The
reason he assigns for his rejection of the goddess is the number and
fatal character of her loves. Among the objects of her affection were
a wild eagle, a lion, a war-horse, a ruler, and a husbandman; and all
these came to grief. Ishtar, angry at her rejection, complains to her
father, Anu, and her mother, Anatu, and begs them to avenge her
wrong. Anu creates a divine bull and sends it against Gilgamesh,
who, however, with the aid of his friend Eabani, slays the bull.
Ishtar curses Gilgamesh, but Eabani turns the curse against her.</p>

<p>The seventh tablet recounts how Ishtar descends to the underworld
seeking some better way of attacking the hero. The description of
the Babylonian Sheol is one of the most effective portions of the
poem, and with it George Smith connects a well-known poem which
relates the descent of Ishtar to the underworld. The goddess goes
down to the house of darkness from which there is no exit, and
demands admittance of the keeper; who, however, by command of
the queen of the lower world, requires her to submit to the conditions
imposed on all who enter. There are seven gates, at each of
which he removes some portion of her ornaments and dress. Ishtar,
thus unclothed, enters and becomes a prisoner. Meantime the upper
earth has felt her absence. All love and life has ceased. Yielding
to the persuasions of the gods, Ea sends a messenger to demand
the release of the goddess. The latter passes out, receiving at each
gate a portion of her clothing. This story of Ishtar's love belongs to
one of the earliest stages of religious belief. Not only do the gods
appear as under the control of ordinary human passions, but there is
no consciousness of material difference between man and beast. The
Greek parallels are familiar to all. Of these ideas we find no trace
in the later Babylonian and Assyrian literature, and the poem was
doubtless interpreted by the Babylonian sages in allegorical fashion.</p>

<p>In the eighth and ninth tablets the death of Eabani is recorded,
and the grief of Gilgamesh. The latter then wanders forth in search
of Hasisadra, the hero of the Flood-story. After various adventures
he reaches the abode of the divinized man, and from him learns the
story of the Flood, which is given in the eleventh tablet.</p>

<p>This story is almost identical with that of the Book of Genesis.
The God Bel is determined to destroy mankind, and Hasisadra
receives directions from Ea to build a ship, and take into it provisions
and goods and slaves and beasts of the field. The ship is covered
with bitumen. The flood is sent by Shamash (the sun-god).
Hasisadra enters the ship and shuts the door. So dreadful is the
tempest that the gods in affright ascend for protection to the heaven
of Anu. Six days the storm lasts. On the seventh conies calm.
Hasisadra opens a window and sees the mountain of Nizir, sends forth
a dove, which returns; then a swallow, which returns; then a raven,
which does not return; then, knowing that the flood has passed, sends
out the animals, builds an altar, and offers sacrifice, over which the
gods gather like flies. Ea remonstrates with Bel, and urges that hereafter,
when he is angry with men, instead of sending a deluge, he
shall send wild beasts, who shall destroy them. Thereupon Bel makes
a compact with Hasisadra, and the gods take him and his wife and
people and place them in a remote spot at the mouth of the rivers.
It is now generally agreed that the Hebrew story of the Flood is
taken from the Babylonian, either mediately through the Canaanites
(for the Babylonians had occupied Canaan before the sixteenth century
B.C.), or immediately during the exile in the sixth century.
The Babylonian account is more picturesque, the Hebrew more restrained
and solemn. The early polytheistic features have been
excluded by the Jewish editors.</p>

<p>In addition to these longer stories there are a number of legends
of no little poetical and mythical interest. In the cycle devoted to
the eagle there is a story of the struggle between the eagle and the
serpent. The latter complains to the sun-god that the eagle has
eaten his young. The god suggests a plan whereby the hostile bird
may be caught: the body of a wild ox is to be set as a snare. Out
of this plot, however, the eagle extricates himself by his sagacity.
In the second story the eagle comes to the help of a woman who is
struggling to bring a man-child (apparently Etana) into the world.
In the third is portrayed the ambition of the hero Etana to ascend to
heaven. The eagle promises to aid him in accomplishing his design.
Clinging to the bird, he rises with him higher and higher toward the
heavenly space, reaching the abode of Anu, and then the abode of
Ishtar. As they rise to height after height the eagle describes the
appearance of the world lying stretched out beneath: at first it rises
like a huge mountain out of the sea; then the ocean appears as a
girdle encircling the land, and finally but as a ditch a gardener digs
to irrigate his land. When they have risen so high that the earth is
scarcely visible, Etana cries to the eagle to stop; so he does, but his
strength is exhausted, and bird and man fall to the earth.</p>

<p>Another cycle of stories deals with the winds. The god Zu longs
to have absolute power over the world. To that end he lurks about
the door of the sun-god, the possessor of the tablets of fate whereby
he controls all things. Each morning before beginning his journey,
the sun-god steps out to send light showers over the world. Watching
his opportunity, Zu glides in, seizes the tablets of fate, and flies
away and hides himself in the mountains. So great horror comes
over the world: it is likely to be scorched by the sun-god's burning
beams. Anu calls on the storm-god Ramman to conquer Zu, but he
is frightened and declines the task, as do other gods. Here, unfortunately,
the tablet is broken, so that we do not know by whom the
normal order was finally restored.</p>

<p>In the collection of cuneiform tablets disinterred at Amarna in 1887
was found the curious story of Adapa. The demigod Adapa, the son
of Ea, fishing in the sea for the family of his lord, is overwhelmed by
the stormy south wind and cast under the waves. In anger he breaks
the wings of the wind, that it may no longer rage in the storm.
Anu, informed that the south wind no longer blows, summons Adapa
to his presence. Ea instructs his son to put on apparel of mourning,
present himself at Anu's gate, and there make friends with the porters,
Tammuz and Iszida, so that they may speak a word for him to
Anu; going into the presence of the royal deity, he will be offered
food and drink which he must reject, and raiment and oil which
he must accept. Adapa carries out the instructions of his father to
the letter. Anu is appeased, but laments that Adapa, by rejecting
heavenly food and drink, has lost the opportunity to become immortal.
This story, the record of which is earlier than the sixteenth
century B.C., appears to contain two conceptions: it is a mythical
description of the history of the south wind, but its conclusion presents
a certain parallelism with the end of the story of Eden in
Genesis; as there Adam, so here Adapa, fails of immortality because
he infringes the divine command concerning the divine food. We
have here a suggestion that the story in Genesis is one of the cycle
which dealt with the common earthly fact of man's mortality.</p>

<p>The legend of Dibbarra seems to have a historical basis. The god
Dibbarra has devastated the cities of Babylonia with bloody wars.
Against Babylon he has brought a hostile host and slain its people, so
that Marduk, the god of Babylon, curses him. And in like manner
he has raged against Erech, and is cursed by its goddess Ishtar. He
is charged with confounding the righteous and unrighteous in indiscriminate
destruction. But Dibbarra determines to advance against
the dwelling of the king of the gods, and Babylonia is to be further
desolated by civil war. It is a poetical account of devastating wars
as the production of a hostile diety. It is obvious that these legends
have many features in common with those of other lands, myths of
conflict between wind and sun, and the ambition of heroes to scale
the heights of heaven. How far these similarities are the independent
products of similar situations, and how far the results of loans,
cannot at present be determined.</p>

<p>The moral-religious literature of the Babylonians is not inferior in
interest to the stories just mentioned. The hymns to the gods are
characterized by a sublimity and depth of feeling which remind us of
the odes of the Hebrew Psalter. The penitential hymns appear to
contain expressions of sorrow for sin, which would indicate a high
development of the religious consciousness. These hymns, apparently
a part of the temple ritual, probably belong to a relatively late stage
of history; but they are none the less proof that devotional feeling in
ancient times was not limited to any one country.</p>

<p>Other productions, such as the hymn to the seven evil spirits
(celebrating their mysterious power), indicate a lower stage of religious
feeling; this is specially visible in the magic formulas, which
portray a very early stratum of religious history. They recall the
Shamanism of Central Asia and the rites of savage tribes; but there
is no reason to doubt that the Semitic religion in its early stages
contained this magic element, which is found all the world over.</p>

<p>Riddles and Proverbs are found among the Babylonians, as among
all peoples. Comparatively few have been discovered, and these present
nothing of peculiar interest. The following may serve as specimens:--&quot;What
is that which becomes pregnant without conceiving,
fat without eating?&quot; The answer seems to be &quot;A cloud.&quot; &quot;My coal-brazier
clothes me with a divine garment, my rock is founded in the
sea&quot; (a volcano). &quot;I dwell in a house of pitch and brick, but over
me glide the boats&quot; (a canal). &quot;He that says, 'Oh, that I might
exceedingly avenge myself!' draws from a waterless well, and rubs
the skin without oiling it.&quot; &quot;When sickness is incurable and hunger
unappeasable, silver and gold cannot restore health nor appease hunger.&quot;
&quot;As the oven waxes old, so the foe tires of enmity.&quot; &quot;The
life of yesterday goes on every day.&quot; &quot;When the seed is not good,
no sprout comes forth.&quot;</p>

<p>The poetical form of all these pieces is characterized by that parallelism
of members with which we are familiar in the poetry of the
Old Testament. It is rhythmical, but apparently not metrical: the
harmonious flow of syllables in any one line, with more or less beats
or cadences, is obvious; but it does not appear that syllables were
combined into feet, or that there was any fixed rule for the number
of syllables or beats in a line. So also strophic divisions may
be observed, such divisions naturally resulting from the nature of all
narratives. Sometimes the strophe seems to contain four lines, sometimes
more. No strophic rule has yet been established; but it seems
not unlikely that when the longer poetical pieces shall have been
more definitely fixed in form, certain principles of poetical composition
will present themselves. The thought of the mythical pieces and the
prayers and hymns is elevated and imaginative. Some of this poetry
appears to have belonged to a period earlier than 2000 B.C. Yet
the Babylonians constructed no epic poem like the (Iliad,) or at any
rate none such has yet been found. Their genius rather expressed
itself in brief or fragmentary pieces, like the Hebrews and the Arabs.</p>

<p>The Babylonian prose literature consists almost entirely of short
chronicles and annals. Royal inscriptions have been found covering
the period from 3000 B.C. to 539 B.C. There are eponym canons,
statistical lists, diplomatic letters, military reports; but none of these
rise to the dignity of history. Several connected books of chronicles
have indeed been found; there is a synchronistic book of annals of
Babylonia and Assyria, there is a long Assyrian chronicle, and there
are annalistic fragments. But there is no digested historical narrative,
which gives a clear picture of the general civil and political situation,
or any analysis of the characters of kings, generals, and governors, or
any inquiry into causes of events. It is possible that narratives having
a better claim to the name of history may yet be discovered, resembling
those of the Biblical Book of Kings; yet the Book of Kings is
scarcely history--neither the Jews nor the Babylonians and Assyrians
seem to have had great power in this direction.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting collections of historical pieces is that
recently discovered at Amarna. Here, out of a mound which represents
a palace of the Egyptian King Amenhotep IV., were dug up
numerous letters which were exchanged between the kings of Babylonia
and Egypt in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and numerous
reports sent to the Egyptian government by Egyptian governors of
Canaanite cities. These tablets show that at this early time there was
lively communication between the Euphrates and the Nile, and they
give a vivid picture of the chaotic state of affairs in Canaan, which
was exposed to the assaults of enemies on all sides. This country
was then in possession of Egypt, but at a still earlier period it must
have been occupied by the Babylonians. Only in this way can we
account for the surprising fact that the Babylonian cuneiform script
and the Babylonian language form the means of communication
between the east and west and between Egypt and Canaan. The
literary value of these letters is not great; their interest is chiefly
historic and linguistic. The same thing is true of the contract
tablets, which are legal documents: these cover the whole area of
Babylonian history, and show that civil law attained a high state of
perfection; they are couched in the usual legal phrases.</p>

<p>The literary monuments mentioned above are all contained in
tablets, which have the merit of giving in general contemporaneous
records of the things described. But an account of Babylonian literature
would be incomplete without mention of the priest Berosus.
Having, as priest of Bel, access to the records of the temples, he
wrote a history of his native land, in which he preserved the substance
of a number of poetical narratives, as well as the ancient
accounts of the political history. The fragments of his work which
have been preserved (see Cory's 'Ancient Fragments') exhibit a
number of parallels with the contents of the cuneiform tablets.
Though he wrote in Greek (he lived in the time of Alexander the
Great), and was probably trained in the Greek learning of his time,
his work doubtless represents the spirit of Babylonian historical writing.
So far as can be judged from the remains which have come
down to us, its style is of the annalistic sort which appears in the
old inscriptions and in the historical books of the Bible.</p>

<p>The Babylonian literature above described must be understood to
include the Assyrian. Civilization was first established in Babylonia,
and there apparently were produced the great epic poems and the
legends. But Assyria, when she succeeded to the headship of the
Mesopotamian valley, in the twelfth century B.C., adopted the literature
of her southern sister. A great part of the old poetry has been
found in the library of Assurbanipal, at Nineveh (seventh century
B.C.), where a host of scribes occupied themselves with the study of
the ancient literature. They seem to have had almost all the apparatus
of modern critical work. Tablets were edited, sometimes with
revisions. There are bilingual tablets, presenting in parallel columns
the older texts (called Sumerian-Accadian) and the modern version.
There are numerous grammatical and lexicographical lists. The records
were accessible, and often consulted. Assurbanipal, in bringing
back a statue of the goddess Nana from the Elamite region, says that
it was carried off by the Elamites 1635 years before; and Nabonidus,
the last king of Babylon (circa B.C. 550), a man devoted to temple
restoration, refers to an inscription of King Naram-Sin, of Agane, who,
he says, reigned 3200 years before. In recent discoveries made at
Nippur, by the American Babylonian Expedition, some Assyriologists
find evidence of the existence of a Babylonian civilization many centuries
before B.C. 4000 (the dates B.C. 5000 and B.C. 6000 have been
mentioned); the material is now undergoing examination, and it is too
early to make definite statements of date. See Peters in American
Journal of Archaeology for January-March, 1895, and July-September,
1895; and Hilprecht, 'The Babylonian Expedition of the University of
Pennsylvania,' Vol. i., Part 2, 1896.</p>

<p>The Assyrian and Babylonian historical inscriptions, covering as
they do the whole period of Jewish history down to the capture of
Babylon by Cyrus, are of very great value for the illustration of the
Old Testament. They have a literary interest also. Many of them
are written in semi-rhythmical style, a form which was favored by
the inscriptional mode of writing. The sentences are composed of
short parallel clauses, and the nature of the material induced a division
into paragraphs which resemble strophes. They are characterized
also by precision and pithiness of statement, and are probably as
trust-worthy as official records ever are.</p>

<p class="i2">Told me the desire of his heart.</p>

<p>[In this happy state they were ready to accept Marduk's conditions.]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>To Marduk, their avenger, they gave over the rule.</p>
<p>They lifted him up on a lofty throne,</p>
<p>Above his fathers he took his place as judge:--</p>
<p>Most honored be thou among the great gods,</p>
<p>Unequaled thy rule, thy word is Anu.</p>
<p>From this time forth thy command be not gainsaid;</p>
<p>To lift up and cast down be the work of thy hand;</p>
<p>The speech of thy mouth stand fast, thy word be irresistible,</p>
<p>None of the gods shall intrude on thy domain,</p>
<p>Fullness of wealth, the desire of the temples of the gods,</p>
<p>Be the portion of thy shrine, though they be in need.</p>
<p>Marduk, thou, our avenger,</p>
<p>Thine be the kingdom over all forever.</p>
<p>Sit thee down in might, noble be thy word,</p>
<p>Thy arms shall never yield, the foes they shall crush.</p>
<p>O lord, he who trusts in thee, him grant thou life,</p>
<p>But the deity who set evil on foot, her life pour out.</p>
<p>Then in the midst they placed a garment.</p>
<p>To Marduk their first-born thus spake they:--</p>
<p>Thy rule, O lord, be chief among the gods,</p>
<p>To destroy and to create--speak and let it be.</p>
<p>Open thy mouth, let the garment vanish.</p>
<p>Utter again thy command, let the garment appear.</p>
<p>He spake with his mouth, vanished the garment;</p>
<p>Again he commanded, and the garment appeared.</p>
<p>When the gods, his fathers, saw thus his word fulfilled,</p>
<p>Joyful were they and did homage: Marduk is king.</p>
<p>On him conferred sceptre and throne....</p>
<p>Gave him invincible arms to crush them that hate him.</p>
<p>Now go and cut short the life of Tiamat,</p>
<p>May the winds into a secret place carry her blood.</p>
<p>The ruler of the gods they made him, the gods, his fathers,</p>
<p>Wished him success and glory in the way on which he went.</p>
<p>He made ready a bow, prepared it for use,</p>
<p>Made ready a spear to be his weapon.</p>
<p>He took the ... seized it in his right hand,</p>
<p>Bow and quiver hung at his side,</p>
<p>Lightning he fashioned flashing before him,</p>
<p>With glowing flame he filled its body,</p>
<p>A net he prepared to seize Tiamat,</p>
<p>Guarded the four corners of the world that nothing of her should escape,</p>
<p>On South and North, on East and West</p>
<p>He laid the net, his father Anu's gift.</p>
<p>He fashioned the evil wind, the south blast, the tornado,</p>
<p>The four-and-seven wind, the wind of destruction and woe,</p>
<p>Sent forth the seven winds which he had made</p>
<p>Tiamat's body to destroy, after him they followed.</p>
<p>Then seized the lord the thunderbolt, his mighty weapon,</p>
<p>The irresistible chariot, the terrible, he mounted,</p>
<p>To it four horses he harnessed, pitiless, fiery, swift,</p>
<p>Their teeth were full of venom covered with foam.</p>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<p>On it mounted Marduk the mighty in battle.</p>
<p>To right and left he looked, lifting his eye.</p>
<p>His terrible brightness surrounded his head.</p>
<p>Against her he advanced, went on his way,</p>
<p>To Tiamat lifted his face.</p>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
They looked at him, at him looked the gods,<br>
The gods, his fathers, looked at him; at him looked the gods.<br>
And nearer pressed the lord, with his eye piercing Tiamat.<br>
On Kingu her consort rested his look.<br>
As he so looked, every way is stopped.<br>
His senses Kingu loses, vanishes his thought,<br>
And the gods, his helpers, who stood by his side<br>
Saw their leader powerless....<br>
But Tiamat stood, not turning her back.<br>
With fierce lips to him she spake:--<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
Then grasped the lord his thunderbolt, his mighty weapon,<br>
Angry at Tiamat he hurled his words:--<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
When Tiamat heard these words,<br>
She fell into fury, beside herself was she.<br>
Tiamat cried wild and loud<br>
Till through and through her body shook.<br>
She utters her magic formula, speaks her word,<br>
And the gods of battle rush to arms.<br>
Then advance Tiamat, and Marduk the ruler of the gods<br>
To battle they rush, come on to the fight.<br>
His wide-stretched net over her the lord did cast,<br>
The evil wind from behind him he let loose in her face.<br>
Tiamat opened her throat as wide as she might,<br>
Into it he sent the evil wind before she could close her lips.<br>
The terrible winds filled her body,<br>
Her senses she lost, wide open stood her throat.<br>
He seized his spear, through her body he ran it,<br>
Her inward parts he hewed, cut to pieces her heart.<br>
Her he overcame, put an end to her life,<br>
Cast away her corpse and on it stood.<br>
So he, the leader, slew Tiamat,<br>
Her power he crushed, her might he destroyed.<br>
Then the gods, her helpers, who stood at her side,<br>
Fear and trembling seized them, their backs they turned,<br>
Away they fled to save their lives.<br>
Fast were they girt, escape they could not,<br>
Captive he took them, broke in pieces their arms.<br>
They were caught in the net, sat in the toils,<br>
All the earth they filled with their cry.<br>
Their doom they bore, held fast in prison,<br>
And the eleven creatures, clothed with dread,<br>
A herd of demons who with her went,<br>
These he subdued, destroyed their power,<br>
Crushed their valor, trod them under foot;<br>
And Kingu, who had grown great over them all,<br>
Him he overcame with the god Kugga,<br>
Took from him the tablets of fate which were not rightfully his,<br>
Stamped thereon his seal, and hung them on his breast.<br>
When thus the doughty Marduk had conquered his foes,<br>
His proud adversary to shame had brought,<br>
Had completed Anshar's triumph over the enemy,<br>
Had fulfilled Nudimmud's will,<br>
Then the conquered gods he put in prison,<br>
And to Tiamat, whom he had conquered, returned.<br>
Under his foot the lord Tiamat's body trod,<br>
With his irresistible club he shattered her skull,<br>
Through the veins of her blood he cut;<br>
Commanded the north wind to bear it to a secret place.<br>
His fathers saw it, rejoiced and shouted.<br>
Gifts and offerings to him they brought.<br>
The lord was appeased seeing her corpse.<br>
Dividing her body, wise plans he laid.<br>
Into two halves like a fish he divided her,<br>
Out of one half he made the vault of heaven,<br>
A bar he set and guards he posted,<br>
Gave them command that the waters pass not through.<br>
Through the heaven he strode, viewed its spaces,<br>
Near the deep placed Nudimmud's dwelling.<br>
And the lord measured the domain of the deep,<br>
A palace like it, Eshara, he built,<br>
The palace Eshara which he fashioned as heaven.<br>
Therein made he Anu, Bel, and Ea to dwell.<br>
He established the station of the great gods,<br>
Stars which were like them, constellations he set,<br>
The year he established, marked off its parts,<br>
Divided twelve months by three stars,<br>
From the day that begins the year to the day that ends it<br>
He established the station Nibir to mark its limits.<br>
That no harm come, no one go astray,<br>
The stations of Bel and Ea be set by its side.<br>
Great doors he made on this side and that,<br>
Closed them fast on left and right.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
The moon-god he summoned, to him committed the night.<br>

To the underworld I turn,<br>
I spread my wings like a bird,<br>
I descend to the house of darkness, to the dwelling of Irkalla,<br>
To the house from which there is no exit,<br>
The road on which there is no return,<br>
To the house whose dwellers long for light,<br>
Dust is their nourishment and mud their food,<br>
Whose chiefs are like feathered birds,<br>
Where light is never seen, in darkness they dwell.<br>
In the house which I will enter<br>
There is treasured up for me a crown,<br>
With the crowned ones who of old ruled the earth,<br>
To whom Anu and Bel have given terrible names,<br>
Carrion is their food, their drink stagnant water.<br>
There dwell the chiefs and unconquered ones,<br>
There dwell the bards and the mighty men,<br>
Monsters of the deep of the great gods.<br>
It is the dwelling of Etana, the dwelling of Ner,<br>
Of Ninkigal, the queen of the underworld....<br>
Her I will approach and she will see me.<br>

<p class="i2">ISHTAR'S DESCENT TO THE UNDERWORLD</p>
</div></div>
<p>[After a description substantially identical with the first half of the
preceding poem, the story goes on:--]</p>

To the gate of the underworld Ishtar came,<br>
To the keeper of the gate her command she addressed:--<br>
Keeper of the waters, open thy gate,<br>
Open thy gate that I may enter.<br>
If thou open not the gate and let me in,<br>
I will strike the door, the posts I will shatter,<br>
I will strike the hinges, burst open the doors,<br>
I will raise up the dead devourers of the living,<br>
Over the living the dead shall triumph.<br>
The keeper opened his mouth and spake,<br>
To the Princess Ishtar he cried:--<br>
Stay, lady, do not thus,<br>
Let me go and repeat thy words to Queen Ninkigal.<br>

<p>[He goes and gets the terrible queen's permission for Ishtar to enter on
certain conditions.]</p>

Through the first gate he caused her to pass<br>
The crown of her head he took away.<br>
Why, O keeper, takest thou away the great crown of my head?<br>
Thus, O lady, the goddess of the underworld doeth to all her visitors at the entrance.<br>
Through the second gate he caused her to pass,<br>
The earrings of her ears he took away.<br>
Why, O keeper, takest thou away the earrings of my ears?<br>
So, O lady, the goddess of the underworld doeth to all that enter her realm.<br>

<p>[And so at each gate till she is stripped of clothing. A long time Ninkigal
holds her prisoner, and in the upper world love vanishes and men and
gods mourn. Ea sees that Ishtar must return, and sends his messenger to
bring her.]</p>

Go forth, O messenger,<br>
Toward the gates of the underworld set thy face,<br>
Let the seven gates of Hades be opened at thy presence,<br>
Let Ninkigal see thee and rejoice at thy arrival,<br>
That her heart be satisfied and her anger be removed.<br>
Appease her by the names of the great gods . . .<br>
Ninkigal, when this she heard,<br>
Beat her breast and wrung her hands,<br>
Turned away, no comfort would she take.<br>
Go, thou messenger,<br>
Let the great jailer keep thee,<br>
The refuse of the city be thy food,<br>
The drains of the city thy drink,<br>
The shadow of the dungeon be thy resting-place,<br>
The slab of stone be thy seat.<br>
Ninkigal opened her mouth and spake,<br>
To Simtar, her attendant, her command she gave.<br>
Go, Simtar, strike the palace of judgment,<br>
Pour over Ishtar the water of life, and bring her before me.<br>
Simtar went and struck the palace of judgment,<br>
On Ishtar he poured the water of life and brought her.<br>
Through the first gate he caused her to pass,<br>
And restored to her her covering cloak.<br>

<p>[And so through the seven gates till all her ornaments are restored. The
result of the visit to the underworld is not described.]</p>

<p><a name="IV._THE_FLOOD"></a>IV. THE FLOOD</p>
<br>

<p>[The hero Gilgamesh (Izdubar), wandering in search of healing for his
sickness, finds Hasisadra (Xisuthros), the Babylonian Noah, who tells
him the story of the Flood.]</p>

Hasisadra spake to him, to Gilgamesh:---<br>
To thee I will reveal, Gilgamesh, the story of my deliverance,<br>
And the oracle of the gods I will make known to thee.<br>
The city Surippak, which, as thou knowest,<br>
Lies on the Euphrates' bank,<br>
Already old was this city<br>
When the gods that therein dwell<br>
To send a flood their heart impelled them,<br>
All the great gods: their father Anu,<br>
Their counsellor the warlike Bel,<br>
Adar their throne-bearer and the Prince Ennugi.<br>
The lord of boundless wisdom,<br>
Ea, sat with them in council.<br>
Their resolve he announced and so he spake:--<br>
O thou of Surippak, son of Ubaratutu,<br>
Leave thy house and build a ship.<br>
They will destroy the seed of life.<br>
Do thou preserve in life, and hither bring the seed of life<br>
Of every sort into the ship.<br>

<p>[Here follows a statement of the dimensions of the ship, but the numbers
are lost.]</p>

When this I heard to Ea my lord I spake:--<br>
The building of the ship, O lord, which thou commandest<br>
If I perform it, people and elders will mock me.<br>
Ea opened his mouth and spake,<br>
Spake to me, his servant:--<br>

<p>[The text is here mutilated: Hasisadra is ordered to threaten the mockers
with Ea's vengeance.]</p>

Thou, however, shut not thy door till I shall send thee word.<br>
Then pass through the door and bring<br>
All grain and goods and wealth,<br>
Family, servants and maids and all thy kin,<br>
The cattle of the field, the beasts of the field.<br>
Hasisadra opened his mouth, to Ea his lord he said:--<br>
O my lord, a ship in this wise hath no one ever built....<br>

<p>[Hasisadra tells how he built the ship according to Ea's directions.]</p>

All that I had I brought together,<br>
All of silver and all of gold,<br>
And all of the seed of life into the ship I brought.<br>
And my household, men and women,<br>
The cattle of the field, the beasts of the field,<br>
And all my kin I caused to enter.<br>
Then when the sun the destined time brought on,<br>
To me he said at even-fall:--<br>
Destruction shall the heaven rain.<br>
Enter the ship and close the door.<br>
With sorrow on that day I saw the sun go down.<br>
The day on which I was to enter the ship I was afraid.<br>
Yet into the ship I went, behind me the door I closed.<br>
Into the hands of the steersman I gave the ship with its cargo.<br>
Then from the heaven's horizon rose the dark cloud<br>
Raman uttered his thunder,<br>
Nabu and Sarru rushed on,<br>
Over hill and dale strode the throne-bearers,<br>
Adar sent ceaseless streams, floods the Anunnaki brought.<br>
Their power shakes the earth,<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;"><br>
<br>
Raman's billows up to heaven mount,<br>
All light to darkness is turned.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;"><br>
<br>
Brother looks not after brother, no man for another cares.<br>
The gods in heaven are frightened, refuge they seek,<br>
Upward they mount to the heaven of Anu.<br>
Like a dog in his lair,<br>
So cower the gods together at the bars of heaven.<br>
Ishtar cries out in pain, loud cries the exalted goddess:--<br>
All is turned to mire.<br>
This evil to the gods I announced, to the gods foretold the evil.<br>
This exterminating war foretold<br>
Against my race of mankind.<br>
Not for this bare I men that like the brood of the fishes<br>
They should fill the sea.<br>
Then wept the gods with her over the Anunnaki,<br>
In lamentation sat the gods, their lips hard pressed together.<br>
Six days and seven nights ruled wind and flood and storm.<br>
But when the seventh day broke, subsided the storm, and the flood<br>

Which raged like a mighty host, settled itself to quiet.<br>
Down went the sea, ceased storm and flood.<br>
Through the sea I rode lamenting.<br>
The upper dwellings of men were ruined,<br>
Corpses floated like trees.<br>
A window I opened, on my face the daylight fell.<br>
I shuddered and sat me down weeping,<br>
Over my face flowed my tears.<br>
I rode over regions of land, on a terrible sea.<br>
Then rose one piece of land twelve measures high.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dawn of the seventh day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a dove and sent it forth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither and thither flew the dove,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No resting-place it found, back to me it came.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A swallow I took and sent it forth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No resting-place it found, and back to me it came.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A raven I took and sent it forth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth flew the raven and saw that the water had fallen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully waded on but came not back.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the animals then to the four winds I sent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sacrifice I offered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An altar I built on the mountain-top,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sevens I placed the vessels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under them spread sweet cane and cedar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods inhaled the smoke, inhaled the sweet-smelling smoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flies the gods collected over the offering.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither then came Ishtar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted on high her bow, which Anu had made:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days I will not forget, will keep them in remembrance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them I will never forget.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the gods come to the altar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let not Bel to the altar come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he heedlessly wrought, the flood he brought on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To destruction my people gave over.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither came Bel and saw the ship,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of anger was he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the gods and the spirits of heaven:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What soul has escaped!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the destruction no man shall live.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Adar opened his mouth and spake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake to the warlike Bel:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who but Ea knew it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew and all he hath told.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ea opened his mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake to the warlike Bel:--<br>
Thou art the valiant leader of the gods,<br>
Why hast thou heedlessly wrought, and brought on the flood?<br>
Let the sinner bear his sin, the wrongdoer his wrong;<br>
Yield to our request, that he be not wholly destroyed.<br>
Instead of sending a flood, send lions that men be reduced;<br>
Instead of sending a flood, send hyenas that men be reduced;<br>
Instead of sending a flood, send flames to waste the land;<br>
Instead of sending a flood, send pestilence that men be reduced.<br>
The counsel of the great gods to him I did not impart;<br>
A dream to Hasisadra I sent, and the will of the gods he learned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came right reason to Bel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the ship he entered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Took my hand and lifted me up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised my wife and laid her hand in mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To us he turned, between us he stepped,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His blessing he gave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Human Hasisadra has been,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he and his wife united<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to the gods shall be raised,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hasisadra shall dwell far off at the mouth of the streams.<br>

<br>
To Samas came the snake and said:--<br>
The eagle has come to my nest, my young are scattered.<br>
See, O Samas, what evil he has done me.<br>
Help me, thy nest is as broad as the earth,<br>
Thy snare is like the heavens,<br>
Who can escape out of thy net?<br>
Hearing the snake's complaint,<br>
Samas opened his mouth and spake:--<br>
Get thee on thy way, go to the mountain.<br>
A wild ox shall be thy hiding-place.<br>
Open his body, tear out his inward parts,<br>
Make thy dwelling within him.<br>
All the birds of heaven will descend, with them will come the eagle,<br>
Heedless and hurrying on the flesh he will swoop,<br>
Thinking of that which is hidden inside.<br>
So soon as he enters the ox, seize his wing,<br>
Tear off his wing-feathers and claws,<br>
Pull him to pieces and cast him away,<br>
Let him die of hunger and thirst.<br>
So as the mighty Samas commanded,<br>
Rose the snake, went to the mountain,<br>
There he found a wild ox,<br>
Opened his body, tore out his inward parts,<br>
Entered and dwelt within him.<br>
And the birds of heaven descended, with them came the eagle.<br>
Yet the eagle, fearing a snare, ate not of the flesh with the birds.<br>
The eagle spake to his young:--<br>
We will not fly down, nor eat of the flesh of the wild ox.<br>
An eaglet, keen of eye, thus to his father spake:--<br>
In the flesh of the ox lurks the snake<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a mountain looks the land, the sea like petty waters.<br>

He sees the badges of rule,<br>
His royal crown, his raiment divine.<br>
On the tablets of fate of the god Zu fixes his look.<br>
On the father of the gods, the god of Duranki, Zu fixes his gaze.<br>
Lust after rule enters into his soul.<br>
I will take the tablets of fate of the gods,<br>
Will determine the oracle of all the gods,<br>
Will set up my throne, all orders control,<br>
Will rule all the heavenly spirits.<br>
His heart was set on combat.<br>
At the entrance of the hall he stands, waiting the break of day,<br>
When Bel dispensed the tender rains,<br>
Sat on his throne, put off his crown,<br>
He snatched the tablets of fate from his hands,<br>
Seized the power, the control of commands.<br>
Down flew Zu, in a mountain he hid.<br>
There was anguish and crying.<br>
On the earth Bel poured out his wrath.<br>
Anu opened his mouth and spake,<br>
Said to the gods his children:--<br>
Who will conquer Zu?<br>
Great shall be his name among the dwellers of all lands.<br>
They called for Ramman, the mighty, Anu's son.<br>
To him gives Anu command:--<br>
Up, Ramman, my son, thou hero,<br>
From thine attack desist not, conquer Zu with thy weapons,<br>
That thy name may be great in the assembly of the great gods.<br>
Among the gods thy brethren, none shall be thy equal,<br>
Thy shrines on high shall be built;<br>
Found thee cities in all the world;<br>
Thy cities shall reach to the mountain of the world;<br>
Show thyself strong for the gods, strong be thy name!<br>
To Anu his father's command Ramman answered and spake:--<br>
My father, who shall come to the inaccessible mound?<br>
Who is like unto Zu among the gods thy sons?<br>
The tablets of fate he has snatched from his hands,<br>
Seized on the power, the control of commands.<br>
Zu has fled and hides in his mountain.<br>

<br>
Under the water the Southwind blew him<br>
Sunk him to the home of the fishes.<br>
O Southwind, ill hast thou used me, thy wings I will break.<br>
As thus with his mouth he spake the wings of the Southwind were broken.<br>
Seven days long the Southwind over the earth blew no more.<br>
To his messenger Ila-Abrat<br>
Anu then spake thus:--<br>
Why for seven days long<br>
Blows the Southwind no more on the earth?<br>
His messenger Ila-Abrat answered and said: My lord,<br>
Adapa, Ea's son, hath broken the wings of the Southwind.<br>
When Anu heard these words,<br>
&quot;Aha!&quot; he cried, and went forth.<br>
<br>
<p>[Ea, the ocean-god, then directs his son how to proceed in order to avert
Anu's wrath. Some lines are mutilated.]</p>
<br>
At the gate of Anu stand.<br>
The gods Tammuz and Iszida will see thee and ask:--<br>
Why lookest thou thus, Adapa,<br>
For whom wearest thou garments of mourning?<br>
From the earth two gods have vanished, therefore do I thus.<br>
Who are these two gods who from the earth have vanished?<br>
At each other they will look, Tammuz and Iszida, and lament.<br>
A friendly word they will speak to Anu<br>
Anu's sacred face they will show thee.<br>
When thou to Anu comest,<br>
Food of death will be offered thee, eat not thereof.<br>
Water of death will be offered thee, drink not thereof.<br>
A garment will be offered thee, put it on.<br>
Oil will be offered thee, anoint thyself therewith.<br>
What I tell thee neglect not, keep my word in mind.<br>
Then came Anu's messenger:--<br>
The wing of the Southwind Adapa has broken,<br>
Deliver him up to me.<br>
Up to heaven he came, approached the gate of Anu.<br>
At Anu's gate Tammuz and Iszida stand,<br>
Adapa they see, and &quot;Aha!&quot; they cry.<br>
O Adapa, wherefore lookest thou thus,<br>
For whom wearest thou apparel of mourning?<br>
From the earth two gods have vanished<br>
Therefore I wear apparel of mourning.<br>
Who are these two gods who from the earth have vanished?<br>
At one another look Tammuz and Iszida and lament.<br>
Adapa go hence to Anu.<br>
When he came, Anu at him looked, saying, O Adapa,<br>
Why hast thou broken the Southwind's wing?<br>
Adapa answered: My lord,<br>
'Fore my lord's house I was fishing,<br>
In the midst of the sea, it was smooth,<br>
Then the Southwind began to blow<br>
Under it forced me, to the home of the fishes I sank.<br>
<br>
<p>[By this speech Ann's anger is turned away.]</p>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A beaker he set before him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall we offer him? Food of life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare for him that he may eat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Food of life was brought for him, but he ate not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Water of life was brought for him, but he drank not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A garment was brought him, he put it on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil they gave him, he anointed himself therewith.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anu looked at him and mourned:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Adapa, wherefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has thou not eaten or drunken?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now canst thou not live forever ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ea, my lord, commanded me:--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not eat nor drink.<br>

<h2><a name="ABIGAIL_ADAMS"></a>ABIGAIL ADAMS</h2>
<h3>(1744-1818)</h3>

<h3>BY LUCIA GILBERT RUNKLE</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he Constitution of the State of Massachusetts, adopted in the
year 1780, contains an article for the Encouragement of
Literature, which, it declares, should be fostered because its
influence is &quot;to countenance and inculcate the principles of humanity
and general benevolence, public and private charity, industry and frugality,
honesty and punctuality in dealings, sincerity and good humor,
and all social affections and generous sentiments among the people.&quot;
In these words, as in a mirror, is reflected the Massachusetts of the
eighteenth century, where households like
the Adamses', the Warrens', the Otises',
made the standard of citizenship. Six
years before this remarkable document
was framed, Abigail Adams had written
to her husband, then engaged in nation-making
in Philadelphia:--&quot;I most sincerely
wish that some more liberal plan might
be laid and executed for the benefit of
the rising generation, and that our new
Constitution may be distinguished for encouraging
learning and virtue.&quot; And he,
spending his days and nights for his country,
sacrificing his profession, giving up
the hope of wealth, writes her:--&quot;I believe my children will think
that I might as well have labored a little, night and day, for their
benefit. But I will tell them that I studied and labored to procure
a free constitution of government for them to solace themselves
under; and if they do not prefer this to ample fortune, to ease and
elegance, they are not my children. They shall live upon thin diet,
wear mean clothes, and work hard with cheerful hearts and free
spirits, or they may be the children of the earth, or of no one,
for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/092.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>In old Weymouth, one of those quiet Massachusetts towns, half-hidden
among the umbrageous hills, where the meeting-house and the
school-house rose before the settlers' cabins were built, where the one
elm-shaded main street stretches its breadth between two lines of
self-respecting, isolated frame houses, each with its grassy dooryard,
its lilac bushes, its fresh-painted offices, its decorous wood-pile laid
with architectural balance and symmetry,--there, in the dignified
parsonage, on the 11th of November, 1744, was born to Parson William
Smith and Elizabeth his wife, Abigail, the second of three beautiful
daughters. Her mother was a Quincy, of a distinguished line, and
<i>her</i> mother was a Norton, of a strain not less honorable. Nor were
the Smiths unimportant.</p>

<p>In that day girls had little instruction. Abigail says of herself, in
one of her letters:--&quot;I never was sent to any school. Female education,
in the best families, went no further than writing and arithmetic;
in some few and rare instances, music and dancing. It was fashionable
to ridicule female learning.&quot; But the household was bookish.
Her mother knew the &quot;British Poets&quot; and all the literature of Queen
Anne's Augustan age. Her beloved grandmother Quincy, at Mount
Wollaston, seems to have had both learning and wisdom, and to her
father she owed the sense of fun, the shrewdness, the clever way of
putting things which make her letters so delightful.</p>

<p>The good parson was skillful in adapting Scripture to special exigencies,
and throughout the Revolution he astonished his hearers by
the peculiar fitness of his texts to political uses. It is related of him
that when his eldest daughter married Richard Cranch, he preached
to his people from Luke, tenth chapter, forty-second verse: &quot;And
Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away
from her.&quot; When, a year later, young John Adams came courting
the brilliant Abigail, the parish, which assumed a right to be heard
on the question of the destiny of the minister's daughter, grimly objected.
He was upright, singularly abstemious, studious; but he was
poor, he was the son of a small farmer, and she was of the gentry.
He was hot-headed and somewhat tactless, and offended his critics.
Worst of all, he was a lawyer, and the prejudice of colonial society
reckoned a lawyer hardly honest. He won this most important of
his cases, however, and Parson Smith's marriage sermon for the bride
of nineteen was preached from the text, &quot;For John came neither
eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He hath a devil.&quot;</p>

<p>For ten years Mrs. Adams seems to have lived a most happy life,
either in Boston or Braintree, her greatest grief being the frequent
absences of her husband on circuit. His letters to her are many and
delightful, expressing again and again, in the somewhat formal
phrases of the period, his affection and admiration. She wrote
seldom, her household duties and the care of the children, of whom
there were four in ten years, occupying her busy hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the clouds were growing black in the political sky.
Mr. Adams wrote arguments and appeals in the news journals over
Latin signatures, papers of instructions to Representatives to the
General Court, and legal portions of the controversy between the
delegates and Governor Hutchinson. In all this work Mrs. Adams
constantly sympathized and advised. In August, 1774, he went to
Philadelphia as a delegate to a general council of the colonies called
to concert measures for united action. And now begins the famous
correspondence, which goes on for a period of nine years, which was
intended to be seen only by the eyes of her husband, which she
begs him, again and again, to destroy as not worth the keeping, yet
which has given her a name and place among the world's most charming
letter-writers.</p>

<p>Her courage, her cheerfulness, her patriotism, her patience never
fail her. Braintree, where, with her little brood, she is to stay, is
close to the British lines. Raids and foraging expeditions are imminent.
Hopes of a peaceful settlement grow dim. &quot;What course you
can or will take,&quot; she writes her husband, &quot;is all wrapped in the
bosom of futurity. Uncertainty and expectation leave the mind great
scope. Did ever any kingdom or State regain its liberty, when once
it was invaded, without bloodshed? I cannot think of it without horror.
Yet we are told that all the misfortunes of Sparta were occasioned
by their too great solicitude for present tranquillity, and, from
an excessive love of peace, they neglected the means of making it
sure and lasting. They ought to have reflected, says Polybius, that,
'as there is nothing more desirable or advantageous than peace, when
founded in justice and honor, so there is nothing more shameful, and
at the same time more pernicious, when attained by bad measures,
and purchased at the price of liberty.'&quot;</p>

<p>Thus in the high Roman fashion she faces danger; yet her sense
of fun never deserts her, and in the very next letter she writes,
parodying her husband's documents:--&quot;The drouth has been very
severe. My poor cows will certainly prefer a petition to you, setting
forth their grievances, and informing you that they have been deprived
of their ancient privileges, whereby they are become great
sufferers, and desiring that these may be restored to them. More
especially as their living, by reason of the drouth, is all taken from
them, and their property which they hold elsewhere is decaying, they
humbly pray that you would consider them, lest hunger should break
through stone walls.&quot;</p>

<p>By midsummer the small hardships entailed by the British occupation
of Boston were most vexatious. &quot;We shall very soon have no
coffee, nor sugar, nor pepper, but whortleberries and milk we are
not obliged to commerce for,&quot; she writes, and in letter after letter
she begs for pins. Needles are desperately needed, but without pins
how can domestic life go on, and not a pin in the province!</p>

<p>On the 14th of September she describes the excitement in Boston,
the Governor mounting cannon on Beacon Hill, digging intrenchments
on the Neck, planting guns, throwing up breastworks, encamping a
regiment. In consequence of the powder being taken from Charlestown,
she goes on to say, a general alarm spread through all the
towns and was soon caught in Braintree. And then she describes
one of the most extraordinary scenes in history. About eight o'clock
on Sunday evening, she writes to her husband, at least two hundred
men, preceded by a horse-cart, passed by her door in dead silence,
and marched down to the powder-house, whence they took out the
town's powder, because they dared not trust it where there were so
many Tories, carried it into the other parish, and there secreted it.
On their way they captured a notorious &quot;King's man,&quot; and found on
him two warrants aimed at the Commonwealth. When their patriotic
trust was discharged, they turned their attention to the trembling
Briton. Profoundly excited and indignant though they were, they
never thought of mob violence, but, true to the inherited instincts of
their race, they resolved themselves into a public meeting! The
hostile warrants being produced and exhibited, it was put to a vote
whether they should be burned or preserved. The majority voted
for burning them. Then the two hundred gathered in a circle round
the single lantern, and maintained a rigid silence while the offending
papers were consumed. That done--the blazing eyes in that grim
circle of patriots watching the blazing writs--&quot;they called a vote
whether they should huzza; but, it being Sunday evening, it passed
in the negative!&quot;</p>

<p>Only in the New England of John Winthrop and the Mathers, of
John Quincy and the Adamses, would such a scene have been possible:
a land of self-conquest and self-control, of a deep love of the
public welfare and a willingness to take trouble for a public object.</p>

<p>A little later Mrs. Adams writes her husband that there has been
a conspiracy among the negroes, though it has been kept quiet, &quot;I
wish most sincerely,&quot; she adds, &quot;that there was not a slave in the
province. It always appeared a most iniquitous scheme to me--to
fight ourselves for what we are daily robbing and plundering from
those who have as good a right to freedom as we have.&quot;</p>

<p>Nor were the sympathies of this clever logician confined to
the slaves. A month or two before the Declaration of Independence
was made she writes her constructive statesman:--&quot;I long to hear
that you have declared an independence. And by the way, in the
new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to
make, I desire you would remember the ladies, and be more generous
and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited
power into the hands of the husbands! Remember, all men
would be tyrants if they could! If particular care and attention is
not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and
will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice
or representation. That your sex are naturally tyrannical is a truth
so thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute; but such of you
as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of master for
the more tender and endearing one of friend. Why, then, not put
it out of the power of the vicious and the lawless to use us with
cruelty and indignity with impunity? Men of sense in all ages abhor
those customs which treat us only as the vassals of your sex. Regard
us, then, as being placed by Providence under your protection; and
in imitation of the Supreme Being, make use of that power only for
our happiness.&quot;--a declaration of principles which the practical housewife
follows up by saying:--&quot;I have not yet attempted making salt-petre,
but after soap-making, believe I shall make the experiment. I
find as much as I can do to manufacture clothing for my family,
which would else be naked. I have lately seen a small manuscript
describing the proportions of the various sorts of powder fit for cannon,
small arms, and pistols. If it would be of any service your
way, I will get it transcribed and send it to you.&quot;</p>

<p>She is interested in everything, and she writes about everything
in the same whole-hearted way,--farming, paper money, the making
of molasses from corn-stalks, the new remedy of inoculation,
'Common Sense' and its author, the children's handwriting, the state
of Harvard College, the rate of taxes, the most helpful methods
of enlistment, Chesterfield's Letters, the town elections, the higher
education of women, and the getting of homespun enough for Mr.
Adams's new suit.</p>

<p>She manages, with astonishing skill, to keep the household in
comfort. She goes through trials of sickness, death, agonizing suspense,
and ever with the same heroic cheerfulness, that her anxious
husband may be spared the pangs which she endures. When he is
sent to France and Holland, she accepts the new parting as another
service pledged to her country. She sees her darling boy of ten go
with his father, aware that at the best she must bear months of
silence, knowing that they may perish at sea or fall into the hands
of privateers; but she writes with indomitable cheer, sending the lad
tender letters of good advice, a little didactic to modern taste, but
throbbing with affection. &quot;Dear as you are to me,&quot; says this tender
mother, &quot;I would much rather you should have found your grave in
the ocean you have crossed than see you an immoral, profligate, or
graceless child.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the lot of this country parson's daughter to spend three
years in London as wife of the first American minister, to see her
husband Vice-President of the United States for eight years and President
for four, and to greet her son as the eminent Monroe's valued
Secretary of State, though she died, &quot;seventy-four years young,&quot;
before he became President. She could not, in any station, be more
truly a lady than when she made soap and chopped kindling on her
Braintree farm. At Braintree she was no more simply modest than
at the Court of St. James or in the Executive Mansion. Her letters
exactly reflect her ardent, sincere, energetic nature. She shows a
charming delight when her husband tells her that his affairs could
not possibly be better managed than she manages them, and that she
shines not less as a statesman than as a farmeress. And though she
was greatly admired and complimented, no praise so pleased her as
his declaration that for all the ingratitude, calumnies, and misunderstandings
that he had endured,--and they were numberless,--her
perfect comprehension of him had been his sufficient compensation.</p>

<p>I have a request to make of you; something like the barrel

importance to me. It is, that you would send out Mr. Bass, and
purchase me a bundle of pins and put them in your trunk for
me. The cry for pins is so great that what I used to buy for
seven shillings and sixpence are now twenty shillings, and not
to be had for that. A bundle contains six thousand, for which
I used to give a dollar; but if you can procure them for fifty
shillings, or three pounds, pray let me have them. I am, with

<p><i>My Dearest Friend</i>:</p>

<p>The day--perhaps the decisive day is come, on which the
fate of America depends. My bursting heart must find vent
at my pen. I have just heard that our dear friend, Dr. Warren,
is no more, but fell gloriously fighting for his country, saying,
&quot;Better to die honorably in the field than ignominiously hang
upon the gallows.&quot; Great is our loss. He has distinguished
himself in every engagement by his courage and fortitude, by animating
the soldiers, and leading them on by his own example. A
particular account of these dreadful but, I hope, glorious days,
will be transmitted you, no doubt, in the exactest manner.</p>

<p>&quot;The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong;
but the God of Israel is He that giveth strength and power unto
His people. Trust in Him at all times, ye people: pour out your
hearts before Him; God is a refuge for us.&quot; Charlestown is laid
in ashes. The battle began upon our intrenchments upon Bunker's
Hill, Saturday morning about three o'clock, and has not ceased
yet, and it is now three o'clock Sabbath afternoon.</p>

<p>It is expected they will come out over the Neck to-night, and
a dreadful battle must ensue. Almighty God, cover the heads of
our countrymen, and be a shield to our dear friends! How many
have fallen we know not. The constant roar of the cannon is so
distressing that we cannot eat, drink, or sleep. May we be supported
and sustained in the dreadful conflict. I shall tarry here
till it is thought unsafe by my friends, and then I have secured
myself a retreat at your brother's, who has kindly offered me part
of his house. I cannot compose myself to write any further at
present. I will add more as I hear further.</p>

<p>Colonel Warren returned last week to Plymouth, so that I
shall not hear anything from you until he goes back again,
which will not be till the last of this month. He damped
my spirits greatly by telling me that the court had prolonged
your stay another month. I was pleasing myself with the thought
that you would soon be upon your return. It is in vain to repine.
I hope the public will reap what I sacrifice.</p>

<p>I wish I knew what mighty things were fabricating. If a
form of government is to be established here, what one will be
assumed? Will it be left to our Assemblies to choose one? And
will not many men have many minds? And shall we not run into
dissensions among ourselves?</p>

<p>I am more and more convinced that man is a dangerous creature;
and that power, whether vested in many or a few, is ever
grasping, and, like the grave, cries, &quot;Give, give!&quot; The great fish
swallow up the small; and he who is most strenuous for the rights
of the people, when vested with power, is as eager after the prerogatives
of government. You tell me of degrees of perfection to
which human nature is capable of arriving, and I believe it, but
at the same time lament that our admiration should arise from the
scarcity of the instances.</p>

<p>The building up a great empire, which was only hinted at by
my correspondent, may now, I suppose, be realized even by the
unbelievers; yet will not ten thousand difficulties arise in the
formation of it? The reins of government have been so long
slackened that I fear the people will not quietly submit to those
restraints which are necessary for the peace and security of the
community. If we separate from Britain, what code of laws will
be established? How shall we be governed so as to retain our
liberties? Can any government be free which is not administered
by general stated laws? Who shall frame these laws? Who will
give them force and energy? It is true, your resolutions, as a
body, have hitherto had the force of laws; but will they continue
to have?</p>

<p>When I consider these things, and the prejudices of people in
favor of ancient customs and regulations, I feel anxious for the
fate of our monarchy, or democracy, or whatever is to take place.
I soon get lost in the labyrinth of perplexities; but, whatever
occurs, may justice and righteousness be the stability of our times,
and order arise out of confusion. Great difficulties may be surmounted
by patience and perseverance.</p>

<p>I believe I have tired you with politics. As to news, we have
not any at all. I shudder at the approach of winter, when I
think I am to remain desolate.</p>

<p>I must bid you good-night; 'tis late for me, who am much
of an invalid. I was disappointed last week in receiving a packet
by post, and, upon unsealing it, finding only four newspapers.
I think you are more cautious than you need be. All letters, I
believe, have come safe to hand. I have sixteen from you, and
wish I had as many more.</p>

<p>BRAIN TREE, April 20th, 1777.</p>

<p>There is a general cry against the merchants, against monopolizers,
etc., who, 'tis said, have created a partial scarcity.
That a scarcity prevails of every article, not only of luxury
but even the necessaries of life, is a certain fact. Everything
bears an exorbitant price. The Act, which was in some measure
regarded and stemmed the torrent of oppression, is now no more
heeded than if it had never been made. Indian corn at five shillings;
rye, eleven and twelve shillings, but scarcely any to be had
even at that price; beef, eightpence; veal, sixpence and eightpence;
butter, one and sixpence; mutton, none; lamb, none; pork,
none; mean sugar, four pounds per hundred; molasses, none;
cotton-wool, none; New England rum, eight shillings per gallon;
coffee, two and sixpence per pound; chocolate, three shillings.</p>

<p>What can be done? Will gold and silver remedy this evil?
By your accounts of board, housekeeping, etc., I fancy you are
not better off than we are here. I live in hopes that we see the
most difficult time we have to experience. Why is Carolina so
much better furnished than any other State, and at so reasonable
prices?</p>
<blockquote>Your PORTIA.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<a name="HUSBAND6"></a>
<p>BRAINTREE, June 8th, 1779.</p>

<p>Six months have already elapsed since I heard a syllable from
you or my dear son, and five since I have had one single
opportunity of conveying a line to you. Letters of various
dates have lain months at the Navy Board, and a packet and frigate,
both ready to sail at an hour's warning, have been months
waiting the orders of Congress. They no doubt have their reasons,
or ought to have, for detaining them. I must patiently wait
their motions, however painful it is; and that it is so, your own
feelings will testify. Yet I know not but you are less a sufferer
than you would be to hear from us, to know our distresses, and
yet be unable to relieve them. The universal cry for bread, to
a humane heart, is painful beyond description, and the great price
demanded and given for it verifies that pathetic passage of Sacred
Writ, &quot;All that a man hath will he give for his life.&quot; Yet He
who miraculously fed a multitude with five loaves and two fishes
has graciously interposed in our favor, and delivered many of the
enemy's supplies into our hands, so that our distresses have been
mitigated. I have been able as yet to supply my own family,
sparingly, but at a price that would astonish you. Corn is sold at
four dollars, hard money, per bushel, which is equal to eighty at
the rate of exchange.</p>

<p>Labor is at eight dollars per day, and in three weeks it will be
at twelve, it is probable, or it will be more stable than anything
else. Goods of all kinds are at such a price that I hardly dare
mention it. Linens are sold at twenty dollars per yard; the most
ordinary sort of calicoes at thirty and forty; broadcloths at forty
pounds per yard; West India goods full as high; molasses at
twenty dollars per gallon; sugar, four dollars per pound; Bohea
tea at forty dollars; and our own produce in proportion; butcher's
meat at six and eight shillings per pound; board at fifty and
sixty dollars per week; rates high. That, I suppose, you will rejoice
at; so would I, did it remedy the evil. I pay five hundred
dollars, and a new Continental rate has just appeared, my proportion
of which will be two hundred more. I have come to this
determination,--to sell no more bills, unless I can procure hard
money for them, although I shall be obliged to allow a discount.
If I sell for paper, I throw away more than half, so rapid is the
depreciation; nor do I know that it will be received long. I sold
a bill to Blodget at five for one, which was looked upon as high
at that time. The week after I received it, two emissions were
taken out of circulation, and the greater part of what I had
proved to be of that sort; so that those to whom I was indebted
are obliged to wait, and before it becomes due, or is exchanged,
it will be good for--as much as it will fetch, which will be nothing,
if it goes on as it has done for this three months past. I
will not tire your patience any longer. I have not drawn any
further upon you. I mean to wait the return of the Alliance,
which with longing eyes I look for. God grant it may bring
me comfortable tidings from my dear, dear friend, whose welfare
is so essential to my happiness that it is entwined around my
heart, and cannot be impaired or separated from it without rending
it asunder.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I think our affairs go very well here. Our
currency seems to be the source of all our evils. We cannot fill
up our Continental army by means of it. No bounty will prevail
with them. What can be done with it? It will sink in less than
a year. The advantage the enemy daily gains over us is owing
to this. Most truly did you prophesy, when you said that they
would do all the mischief in their power with the forces they had
here.</p>

<p>My tenderest regards ever attend you. In all places and situations,
know me to be ever, ever yours.</p>

<p>AUTEUIL, 5th September, 1784.</p>

<p><i>My, Dear Sister</i>:</p>

<p>Auteuil is a village four miles distant from Paris, and one from
Passy. The house we have taken is large, commodious,
and agreeably situated near the woods of Boulogne, which
belong to the King, and which Mr. Adams calls his park, for he
walks an hour or two every day in them. The house is much
larger than we have need of; upon occasion, forty beds may be
made in it. I fancy it must be very cold in winter. There are
few houses with the privilege which this enjoys, that of having
the salon, as it is called, the apartment where we receive company,
upon the first floor. This room is very elegant, and about
a third larger than General Warren's hall. The dining-room is
upon the right hand, and the salon upon the left, of the entry,
which has large glass doors opposite to each other, one opening
into the court, as they call it, the other into a large and beautiful
garden. Out of the dining-room you pass through an entry
into the kitchen, which is rather small for so large a house. In
this entry are stairs which you ascend, at the top of which is a
long gallery fronting the street, with six windows, and opposite to
each window you open into the chambers, which all look into the
garden.</p>

<p>But with an expense of thirty thousand livres in looking-glasses,
there is no table in the house better than an oak board,
nor a carpet belonging to the house. The floors I abhor, made
of red tiles in the shape of Mrs. Quincy's floor-cloth tiles. These
floors will by no means bear water, so that the method of cleaning
them is to have them waxed, and then a manservant with
foot brushes drives round your room, dancing here and there like
a Merry Andrew. This is calculated to take from your foot every
atom of dirt, and leave the room in a few moments as he found
it. The house must be exceedingly cold in winter. The dining-rooms,
of which you make no other use, are laid with small
stones, like the red tiles for shape and size. The servants' apartments
are generally upon the first floor, and the stairs which you
commonly have to ascend to get into the family apartments are
so dirty that I have been obliged to hold up my clothes as though
I was passing through a cow-yard.</p>

<p>I have been but little abroad. It is customary in this country
for strangers to make the first visit. As I cannot speak the language,
I think I should make rather an awkward figure. I have
dined abroad several times with Mr. Adams's particular friends,
the Abb&eacute;s, who are very polite and civil,--three sensible and
worthy men. The Abb&eacute; de Mably has lately published a book,
which he has dedicated to Mr. Adams. This gentleman is nearly
eighty years old; the Abb&eacute; Chalut, seventy-five; and Arnoux
about fifty, a fine sprightly man, who takes great pleasure in
obliging his friends. Their apartments were really nice. I have
dined once at Dr. Franklin's, and once at Mr. Barclay's, our consul,
who has a very agreeable woman for his wife, and where I
feel like being with a friend. Mrs. Barclay has assisted me in
my purchases, gone with me to different shops, etc. To-morrow
I am to dine at Monsieur Grand's; but I have really felt so
happy within doors, and am so pleasingly situated, that I have
had little inclination to change the scene. I have not been to one
public amusement as yet, not even the opera, though we have
one very near us.</p>

<p>You may easily suppose I have been fully employed, beginning
housekeeping anew, and arranging my family to our no small
expenses and trouble; for I have had bed-linen and table-linen to
purchase and make, spoons and forks to get made of silver,--three
dozen of each,--besides tea furniture, china for the table,
servants to procure, etc. The expense of living abroad I always
supposed to be high, but my ideas were nowise adequate to the
thing. I could have furnished myself in the town of Boston with
everything I have, twenty or thirty per cent, cheaper than I have
been able to do it here. Everything which will bear the name of
elegant is imported from England, and if you will have it, you
must pay for it, duties and all. I cannot get a dozen handsome
wineglasses under three guineas, nor a pair of small decanters for
less than a guinea and a half. The only gauze fit to wear is
English, at a crown a yard; so that really a guinea goes no further
than a copper with us. For this house, garden, stables, etc., we
give two hundred guineas a year. Wood is two guineas and a
half per cord; coal, six livres the basket of about two bushels;
this article of firing we calculate at one hundred guineas a year.
The difference between coming upon this negotiation to France,
and remaining at the Hague, where the house was already furnished
at the expense of a thousand pounds sterling, will increase
the expense here to six or seven hundred guineas; at a time, too,
when Congress has cut off five hundred guineas from what they
have heretofore given. For our coachman and horses alone (Mr.
Adams purchased a coach in England) we give fifteen guineas a
month. It is the policy of this country to oblige you to a certain
number of servants, and one will not touch what belongs to the
business of another, though he or she has time enough to perform
the whole. In the first place, there is a coachman who does
not an individual thing but attend to the carriages and horses;
then the gardener, who has business enough; then comes the cook;
then the <i>maitre d'hotel</i>,--his business is to purchase articles in
the family, and oversee that nobody cheats but himself; a <i>valet de
chambre,</i>--John serves in this capacity; a <i>femme de chambre</i>,--Esther
serves for this, and is worth a dozen others; a <i>coiffeuse</i>,--for
this place I have a French girl about nineteen, whom I have
been upon the point of turning-away, because madam will not
brush a chamber: &quot;it is not de fashion, it is not her business.&quot;
I would not have kept her a day longer, but found, upon inquiry,
that I could not better myself, and hair-dressing here is very
expensive unless you keep such a madam in the house. She
sews tolerably well, so I make her as useful as I can. She is
more particularly devoted to mademoiselle. Esther diverted me
yesterday evening by telling me that she heard her go muttering
by her chamber door, after she had been assisting Abby in dressing.
&quot;Ah, mon Dieu, 'tis provoking&quot;--(she talks a little English).--&quot;Why,
what is the matter, Pauline: what is provoking?&quot;--&quot;Why,
Mademoiselle look so pretty, I so <i>mauvais</i>.&quot; There is
another indispensable servant, who is called a <i>frotteur</i>: his business
is to rub the floors.</p>

<p>We have a servant who acts as <i>maitre d'hotel,</i> whom I like at
present, and who is so very gracious as to act as footman too,
to save the expense of another servant, upon condition that we
give him a gentleman's suit of clothes in lieu of a livery. Thus,
with seven servants and hiring a charwoman upon occasion of
company, we may possibly make out to keep house; with less, we
should be hooted at as ridiculous, and could not entertain any
company. To tell this in our own country would be considered as
extravagance; but would they send a person here in a public character
to be a public jest? At lodgings in Paris last year, during
Mr. Adams's negotiation for a peace, it was as expensive to him
as it is now at housekeeping, without half the accommodations.</p>

<p>Washing is another expensive article: the servants are all
allowed theirs, besides their wages; our own costs us a guinea a
week. I have become steward and bookkeeper, determined to
know with accuracy what our expenses are, to prevail with Mr.
Adams to return to America if he finds himself straitened, as I
think he must be. Mr. Jay went home because he could not
support his family here with the whole salary; what then can be
done, curtailed as it now is, with the additional expense? Mr.
Adams is determined to keep as little company as he possibly
can; but some entertainments we must make, and it is no
unusual thing for them to amount to fifty or sixty guineas at
a time. More is to be performed by way of negotiation, many
times, at one of these entertainments, than at twenty serious conversations;
but the policy of our country has been, and still is,
to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We stand in sufficient
need of economy, and in the curtailment of other salaries I
suppose they thought it absolutely necessary to cut off their
foreign ministers. But, my own interest apart, the system is bad;
for that nation which degrades their own ministers by obliging
them to live in narrow circumstances, cannot expect to be held in
high estimation themselves. We spend no evenings abroad, make
no suppers, attend very few public entertainments,--or spectacles,
as they are called,--and avoid every expense that is not
held indispensable. Yet I cannot but think it hard that a gentleman
who has devoted so great a part of his life to the service
of the public, who has been the means, in a great measure, of
procuring such extensive territories to his country, who saved their
fisheries, and who is still laboring to procure them further advantages,
should find it necessary so cautiously to calculate his pence,
for fear of overrunning them. I will add one more expense.
There is now a court mourning, and every foreign minister, with
his family, must go into mourning for a Prince of eight years old,
whose father is an ally to the King of France. This mourning is
ordered by the Court, and is to be worn eleven days only. Poor
Mr. Jefferson had to his away for a tailor to get a whole black-silk
suit made up in two days; and at the end of eleven days,
should another death happen, he will be obliged to have a new
suit of mourning, of cloth, because that is the season when silk
must be left off. We may groan and scold, but these are expenses
which cannot be avoided; for fashion is the deity every one
worships in this country, and from the highest to the lowest, you
must submit. Even poor John and Esther had no comfort among
the servants, being constantly the subjects of ridicule, until we
were obliged to direct them to have their hair dressed. Esther
had several crying fits upon the occasion, that she should be
forced to be so much of a fool; but there was no way to keep
them from being trampled upon but this, and now that they are
<i>&agrave; la mode de Paris</i>, they are much respected. To be out of
fashion is more criminal than to be seen in a state of nature, to
which the Parisians are not averse.</p>

<p>AUTEUIL, NEAR PARIS, 10th May, 1785.</p>

<p>Did you ever, my dear Betsey, see a person in real life such
as your imagination formed of Sir Charles Grandison? The
Baron de Sta&euml;l, the Swedish Ambassador, comes nearest to
that character, in his manners and personal appearance, of any
gentleman I ever saw. The first time I saw him I was prejudiced
in his favor, for his countenance commands your good opinion:
it is animated, intelligent, sensible, affable, and without being perfectly
beautiful, is most perfectly agreeable; add to this a fine
figure, and who can fail in being charmed with the Baron de
Sta&euml;l? He lives in a grand hotel, and his suite of apartments, his
furniture, and his table, are the most elegant of anything I have
seen. Although you dine upon plate in every noble house in
France, I cannot say that you may see your face in it; but here
the whole furniture of the table was burnished, and shone with
regal splendor. Seventy thousand livres in plate will make no
small figure; and that is what his Majesty gave him. The dessert
was served on the richest china, with knives, forks, and spoons
of gold. As you enter his apartments, you pass through files of
servants into his ante-chamber, in which is a throne covered with
green velvet, upon which is a chair of state, over which hangs
the picture of his royal master. These thrones are common to all
ambassadors of the first order, as they are immediate representatives
of the king. Through this ante-chamber you pass into the
grand salon, which is elegantly adorned with architecture, a beautiful
lustre hanging from the middle. Settees, chairs, and hangings
of the richest silk, embroidered with gold; marble slabs upon
Muted pillars, round which wreaths of artificial flowers in gold
entwine. It is usual to find in all houses of fashion, as in this,
several dozens of chairs, all of which have stuffed backs and
cushions, standing in double rows round the rooms. The dining-room
was equally beautiful, being hung with Gobelin tapestry, the
colors and figures of which resemble the most elegant painting.
In this room were hair-bottom mahogany-backed chairs, and the
first I have seen since I came to France. Two small statues of a
Venus de Medicis, and a Venus de ---- (ask Miss Paine for the
other name), were upon the mantelpiece. The latter, however,
was the most modest of the kind, having something like a loose
robe thrown partly over her. From the Swedish Ambassador's
we went to visit the Duchess d'Enville, who is mother to the
Duke de Rochefoucault. We found the old lady sitting in an easy-chair;
around her sat a circle of Academicians, and by her side a
young lady. Your uncle presented us, and the old lady rose, and,
as usual, gave us a salute. As she had no paint, I could put up
with it; but when she approached your cousin I could think of
nothing but Death taking hold of Hebe. The duchess is near
eighty, very tall and lean. She was dressed in a silk chemise,
with very large sleeves, coming half-way down her arm, a large
cape, no stays, a black-velvet girdle round her waist, some very
rich lace in her chemise, round her neck, and in her sleeves; but
the lace was not sufficient to cover the upper part of her neck,
which old Time had harrowed; she had no cap on, but a little
gauze bonnet, which did not reach her ears, and tied under her
chin, her venerable white hairs in full view. The dress of old
women and young girls in this country is <i>detestable</i>, to speak in
the French style; the latter at the age of seven being clothed
exactly like a woman of twenty, and the former have such a fantastical
appearance that I cannot endure it. The old lady has all
the vivacity of a young one. She is the most learned woman in
France; her house is the resort of all men of literature, with
whom she converses upon the most abstruse subjects. She is of
one of the most ancient, as well as the richest families in the
kingdom. She asked very archly when Dr. Franklin was going to
America. Upon being told, says she, &quot;I have heard that he is a
prophet there;&quot; alluding to that text of Scripture, &quot;A prophet is
not without honor,&quot; etc. It was her husband who commanded
the fleet which once spread such terror in our country.</p>

<p>LONDON, Friday, 24th July 1784.</p>

<p><i>My Dear Sister</i>:</p>

<p>I am not a little surprised to find dress, unless upon public occasions,
so little regarded here. The gentlemen are very plainly
dressed, and the ladies much more so than with us. 'Tis true,
you must put a hoop on and have your hair dressed; but a common
straw hat, no cap, with only a ribbon upon the crown, is
thought dress sufficient to go into company. Muslins are much in
taste; no silks but lutestrings worn; but send not to London for
any article you want: you may purchase anything you can name
much lower in Boston. I went yesterday into Cheapside to purchase
a few articles, but found everything higher than in Boston.
Silks are in a particular manner so; they say, when they are
exported, there is a drawback upon them, which makes them
lower with us. Our country, alas, our country! they are extravagant
to astonishment in entertainments compared with what Mr.
Smith and Mr. Storer tell me of this. You will not find at a
gentleman's table more than two dishes of meat, though invited
several days beforehand. Mrs. Atkinson went out with me yesterday,
and Mrs. Hay, to the shops. I returned and dined with
Mrs. Atkinson, by her invitation the evening before, in company
with Mr. Smith, Mrs. Hay, Mr. Appleton. We had a turbot, a
soup, and a roast leg of lamb, with a cherry pie....</p>

<p>The wind has prevented the arrival of the post. The city of
London is pleasanter than I expected; the buildings more regular,
the streets much wider, and more sunshine than I thought to
have found: but this, they tell me, is the pleasantest season to be
in the city. At my lodgings I am as quiet as at any place in Boston;
nor do I feel as if it could be any other place than Boston.
Dr. Clark visits us every day; says he cannot feel at home anywhere
else: declares he has not seen a handsome woman since he
came into the city; that every old woman looks like Mrs. H----,
and every young one like--like the D---l. They paint here nearly
as much as in France, but with more art. The head-dress disfigures
them in the eyes of an American. I have seen many ladies,
but not one elegant one since I came; there is not to me that
neatness in their appearance which you see in our ladies.</p>

<p>The American ladies are much admired here by the gentlemen,
I am told, and in truth I wonder not at it. Oh, my
country, my country! preserve, preserve the little purity and
simplicity of manners you yet possess. Believe me, they are
jewels of inestimable value; the softness, peculiarly characteristic
of our sex, and which is so pleasing to the gentlemen, is wholly
laid aside here for the masculine attire and manners of Amazonians.</p>
<br>
<a name="SISTER4"></a>
<p>LONDON, BATH HOTEL, WESTMINSTER, 24th June, 1785.</p>

<p><i>My Dear Sister</i>:</p>

<p>I have been here a month without writing a single line to my
American friends. On or about the twenty-eighth of May we
reached London, and expected to have gone into our old quiet
lodgings at the Adelphi; but we found every hotel full. The sitting
of Parliament, the birthday of the King, and the famous
celebration of the music of Handel, at Westminster Abbey, had
drawn together such a concourse of people that we were glad to
get into lodgings at the moderate price of a guinea per day, for
two rooms and two chambers, at the Bath Hotel, Westminster,
Piccadilly, where we yet are. This being the Court end of the
city, it is the resort of a vast concourse of carriages. It is too
public and noisy for pleasure, but necessity is without law. The
ceremony of presentation, upon one week to the King, and the
next to the Queen, was to take place, after which I was to prepare
for mine. It is customary, upon presentation, to receive visits
from all the foreign ministers; so that we could not exchange our
lodgings for more private ones, as we might and should, had we
been only in a private character. The foreign ministers and several
English lords and earls have paid their compliments here,
and all hitherto is civil and polite. I was a fortnight, all the
time I could get, looking at different houses, but could not find any
one fit to inhabit under &pound;200, beside the taxes, which mount up
to &pound;50 or &pound;60. At last my good genius carried me to one in
Grosvenor Square, which was not let, because the person who had
the care of it could let it only for the remaining lease, which was
one year and three-quarters. The price, which is not quite two
hundred pounds, the situation, and all together, induced us to
close the bargain, and I have prevailed upon the person who lets
it to paint two rooms, which will put it into decent order; so that,
as soon as our furniture comes, I shall again commence
housekeeping. Living at a hotel is, I think, more expensive than
housekeeping, in proportion to what one has for his money. We
have never had more than two dishes at a time upon our table,
and have not pretended to ask any company, and yet we live at a
greater expense than twenty-five guineas per week. The wages
of servants, horse hire, house rent, and provisions are much
dearer here than in France. Servants of various sorts, and for
different departments, are to be procured; their characters are to
be inquired into, and this I take upon me, even to the coachman,
You can hardly form an idea how much I miss my son on this,
as well as on many other accounts; but I cannot bear to trouble
Mr. Adams with anything of a domestic kind, who, from morning
until evening, has sufficient to occupy all his time. You can have
no idea of the petitions, letters, and private applications for
assistance, which crowd our doors. Every person represents his
case as dismal. Some may really be objects of compassion, and
some we assist; but one must have an inexhaustible purse to
supply them all. Besides, there are so many gross impositions
practiced, as we have found in more instances than one, that it
would take the whole of a person's time to trace all their stories.
Many pretend to have been American soldiers, some have served
as officers. A most glaring instance of falsehood, however,
Colonel Smith detected in a man of these pretensions, who sent
to Mr. Adams from the King's Bench prison, and modestly
desired five guineas; a qualified cheat, but evidently a man of
letters and abilities: but if it is to continue in this way, a galley
slave would have an easier task.</p>

<p>The Tory venom has begun to spit itself forth in the public
papers, as I expected, bursting with envy that an American
minister should be received here with the same marks of attention,
politeness, and civility, which are shown to the ministers of any
other power. When a minister delivers his credentials to the
King, it is always in his private closet, attended only by the
Minister for Foreign Affairs, which is called a private audience,
and the minister presented makes some little address to his
Majesty, and the same ceremony to the Queen, whose reply was
in these words: &quot;Sir, I thank you for your civility to me and
my family, and I am glad to see you in this country;&quot; then she
very politely inquired whether he had got a house yet. The
answer of his Majesty was much longer; but I am not at liberty
to say more respecting it, than that it was civil and polite, and
that his Majesty said he was glad the choice of his country had
fallen upon him. The news-liars know nothing of the matter;
they represent it just to answer their purpose. Last Thursday,
Colonel Smith was presented at Court, and to-morrow, at the
Queen's circle, my ladyship and your niece make our
compliments. There is no other presentation in Europe in which I
should feel as much as in this. Your own reflections will easily
suggest the reasons.</p>

<p>I have received a very friendly and polite visit from the
Countess of Effingham. She called, and not finding me at home,
left a card. I returned her visit, but was obliged to do it by leaving
my card too, as she was gone out of town; but when her
ladyship returned, she sent her compliments and word that if
agreeable she would take a dish of tea with me, and named her
day. She accordingly came, and appeared a very polite, sensible
woman. She is about forty, a good person, though a little masculine,
elegant in her appearance, very easy and social. The Earl
of Effingham is too well remembered by America to need any
particular recital of his character. His mother is first lady to the
Queen. When her ladyship took leave, she desired I would let
her know the day I would favor her with a visit, as she should be
loath to be absent. She resides, in summer, a little distance
from town. The Earl is a member of Parliament, which obliges
him now to be in town, and she usually comes with him, and
resides at a hotel a little distance from this.</p>

<p>I find a good many ladies belonging to the Southern States
here, many of whom have visited me; I have exchanged visits
with several, yet neither of us have met. The custom is, however,
here much more agreeable than in France, for it is as with
us: the stranger is first visited.</p>

<p>The ceremony of presentation here is considered as indispensable.
There are four minister-plenipotentiaries' ladies here; but
one ambassador, and he has no lady. In France, the ladies of
ambassadors only are presented. One is obliged here to attend the
circles of the Queen, which are held in summer once a fortnight,
but once a week the rest of the year; and what renders it exceedingly
expensive is, that you cannot go twice the same season in
the same dress, and a Court dress you cannot make use of anywhere
else. I directed my mantuamaker to let my dress be elegant,
but plain as I could possibly appear, with decency; accordingly,
it is white lutestring, covered and full trimmed with white
crape, festooned with lilac ribbon and mock point lace, over a
hoop of enormous extent; there is only a narrow train of about
three yards in length to the gown waist, which is put into a ribbon
upon the left side, the Queen only having her train borne.
Ruffle cuffs for married ladies, treble lace lappets, two white
plumes, and a blond lace handkerchief. This is my rigging, I
should have mentioned two pearl pins in my hair, earrings and
necklace of the same kind.</p>
<br>

<p>THURSDAY MORNING.</p>

<p>My head is dressed for St. James's, and in my opinion looks
very tasty. While my daughter's is undergoing the same operation,
I set myself down composedly to write you a few lines.
&quot;Well,&quot; methinks I hear Betsey and Lucy say, &quot;what is cousin's
dress?&quot; White, my dear girls, like your aunt's, only differently
trimmed and ornamented: her train being wholly of white crape,
and trimmed with white ribbon; the petticoat, which is the most
showy part of the dress, covered and drawn up in what are called
festoons, with light wreaths of beautiful flowers; the sleeves white
crape, drawn over the silk, with a row of lace round the sleeve
near the shoulder, another half-way down the arm, and a third
upon the top of the ruffle, a little flower stuck between; a kind
of hat-cap, with three large feathers and a bunch of flowers; a
wreath of flowers upon the hair. Thus equipped, we go in our
own carriage, and Mr. Adams and Colonel Smith in his. But I
must quit my pen to put myself in order for the ceremony, which
begins at two o'clock. When I return, I will relate to you my
reception; but do not let it circulate, as there may be persons
eager to catch at everything, and as much given to misrepresentation
as here. I would gladly be excused the ceremony.</p>
<br>

<p>FRIDAY MORNING.</p>

<p>Congratulate me, my dear sister: it is over. I was too much
fatigued to write a line last evening. At two o'clock we went to
the circle, which is in the drawing-room of the Queen. We
passed through several apartments, lined as usual with spectators
upon these occasions. Upon entering the ante-chamber, the
Baron de Lynden, the Dutch Minister, who has been often here,
came and spoke with me. A Count Sarsfield, a French nobleman,
with whom I was acquainted, paid his compliments. As I
passed into the drawing-room, Lord Carmarthen and Sir Clement
Cotterel Dormer were presented to me. Though they had been
several times here, I had never seen them before. The Swedish
and the Polish Ministers made their compliments, and several
other gentlemen; but not a single lady did I know until the
Countess of Effingham came, who was very civil. There were
three young ladies, daughters of the Marquis of Lothian, who were
to be presented at the same time, and two brides. We were
placed in a circle round the drawing-room, which was very full;
I believe two hundred persons present. Only think of the task!
The royal family have to go round to every person and find small
talk enough to speak to them all, though they very prudently
speak in a whisper, so that only the person who stands next to
you can hear what is said. The King enters the room and goes
round to the right; the Queen and Princesses to the left. The
lord-in-waiting presents you to the King; and the lady-in-waiting
does the same to her Majesty. The King is a personable man;
but, my dear sister, he has a certain countenance, which you and
I have often remarked: a red face and white eyebrows. The
Queen has a similar countenance, and the numerous royal family
confirm the observation. Persons are not placed according to
their rank in the drawing-room, but promiscuously; and when the
King comes in, he takes persons as they stand. When he came
to me, Lord Onslow said, &quot;Mrs. Adams;&quot; upon which I drew off
my right-hand glove, and his Majesty saluted my left cheek; then
asked me if I had taken a walk to-day. I could have told his
Majesty that I had been all the morning preparing to wait upon
him; but I replied, &quot;No, Sire.&quot; &quot;Why, don't you love walking?&quot;
says he. I answered that I was rather indolent in that respect.
He then bowed, and passed on. It was more than two hours
after this before it came to my turn to be presented to the Queen.
The circle was so large that the company were four hours standing.
The Queen was evidently embarrassed when I was presented
to her. I had disagreeable feelings, too. She, however, said,
&quot;Mrs. Adams, have you got into your house? Pray, how do you
like the situation of it?&quot; While the Princess Royal looked compassionate,
and asked me if I was not much fatigued; and observed,
that it was a very full drawing-room. Her sister, who
came next, Princess Augusta, after having asked your niece if she
was ever in England before, and her answering &quot;Yes,&quot; inquired
of me how long ago, and supposed it was when she was very
young. All this is said with much affability, and the ease and
freedom of old acquaintance. The manner in which they make
their tour round the room is, first, the Queen, the lady-in-waiting
behind her, holding up her train; next to her, the Princess Royal;
after her, Princess Augusta, and their lady-in-waiting behind them.
They are pretty, rather than beautiful; well-shaped, fair complexions,
and a tincture of the King's countenance. The two sisters
look much alike; they were both dressed in black and silver silk,
with silver netting upon the coat, and their heads full of diamond
pins. The Queen was in purple and silver. She is not well
shaped nor handsome. As to the ladies of the Court, rank and
title may compensate for want of personal charms; but they are,
in general, very plain, ill-shaped, and ugly; but don't you tell anybody
that I say so. If one wants to see beauty, one must go to
Ranelagh; there it is collected, in one bright constellation. There
were two ladies very elegant, at Court,--Lady Salisbury and
Lady Talbot; but the observation did not in general hold good
that fine feathers make fine birds. I saw many who were vastly
richer dressed than your friends, but I will venture to say that I
saw none neater or more elegant: which praise I ascribe to the
taste of Mrs. Temple and my mantuamaker; for, after having
declared that I would not have any foil or tinsel about me, they
fixed upon the dress I have described.</p>
<br>
<center>[Inclosure <a name="to_her_niece"></a>to her niece]</center>

<p><i>My Dear Betsey</i>:</p>

<p>I believe I once promised to give you an account of that kind
of visiting called a ladies' rout. There are two kinds; one
where a lady sets apart a particular day in the week to see
company. These are held only five months in the year, it being
quite out of fashion to be seen in London during the summer.
When a lady returns from the country she goes round and leaves
a card with all her acquaintance, and then sends them an invitation
to attend her routs during the season. The other kind is
where a lady sends to you for certain evenings, and the cards are
always addressed in her own name, both to gentlemen and ladies.
The rooms are all set open, and card tables set in each room, the
lady of the house receiving her company at the door of the
drawing-room,
where a set number of courtesies are given and received,
with as much order as is necessary for a soldier who goes through
the different evolutions of his exercise. The visitor then proceeds
into the room without appearing to notice any other person, and
takes her seat at the card table.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Nor can the muse her aid impart,<br>
Unskilled in all the terms of art,<br>
Nor in harmonious numbers put<br>
The deal, the shuffle, and the cut.<br>
Go, Tom, and light the ladies up,<br>
It must be one before we sup.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>At these parties it is usual for each lady to play a rubber, as
it is termed, when you must lose or win a few guineas. To give
each a fair chance, the lady then rises and gives her seat to
another set. It is no unusual thing to have your rooms so
crowded that not more than half the company can sit at once,
yet this is called <i>society and polite life</i>. They treat their company
with coffee, tea, lemonade, orgeat, and cake. I know of
but one agreeable circumstance attending these parties, which is,
that you may go away when you please without disturbing anybody.
I was early in the winter invited to Madame de Pinto's,
the Portuguese Minister's. I went accordingly. There were about
two hundred persons present. I knew not a single lady but by
sight, having met them at Court; and it is an established rule,
though you were to meet as often as three nights in the week,
never to speak together, or know each other unless particularly
introduced. I was, however, at no loss for conversation, Madame
de Pinto being very polite, and the foreign ministers being the
most of them present, who had dined with us, and to whom I
had been early introduced. It being Sunday evening, I declined
playing cards; indeed, I always get excused when I can. And
Heaven forbid I should</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Catch the manners living as they rise.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Yet I must submit to a party or two of this kind. Having
attended several, I must return the compliment in the same way.
Yesterday we dined at Mrs. Paradice's. I refer you to Mr.
Storer for an account of this family. Mr. Jefferson, Colonel
Smith, the Prussian and Venetian ministers, were of the company,
and several other persons who were strangers. At eight
o'clock we returned home in order to dress ourselves for the ball
at the French Ambassador's, to which we had received an invitation
a fortnight before. He has been absent ever since our
arrival here, till three weeks ago. He has a levee every Sunday
evening, at which there are usually several hundred persons.
The Hotel de France is beautifully situated, fronting St. James's
Park, one end of the house standing upon Hyde Park. It is a
most superb building. About half-past nine we went, and found
some company collected. Many very brilliant ladies of the first
distinction were present. The dancing commenced about ten,
and the rooms soon filled. The room which he had built for this
purpose is large enough for five or six hundred persons. It is
most elegantly decorated, hung with a gold tissue, ornamented
with twelve brilliant cut lustres, each containing twenty-four
candles. At one end there are two large arches; these were
adorned with wreaths and bunches of artificial flowers upon the
walls; in the alcoves were cornucopiae loaded with oranges, sweetmeats,
and other trifles. Coffee, tea, lemonade, orgeat, and so
forth, were taken here by every person who chose to go for
them. There were covered seats all around the room for those
who chose to dance. In the other rooms, card tables, and a
large faro table, were set; this is a new kind of game, which is
much practiced here. Many of the company who did not dance
retired here to amuse themselves. The whole style of the house
and furniture is such as becomes the ambassador from one of the
first monarchies in Europe. He had twenty thousand guineas
allowed him in the first instance to furnish his house, and an
annual salary of ten thousand more. He has agreeably blended
the magnificence and splendor of France with the neatness and
elegance of England. Your cousin had unfortunately taken a
cold a few days before, and was very unfit to go out. She
appeared so unwell that about one we retired without staying for
supper, the sight of which only I regretted, as it was, in style,
no doubt, superior to anything I have seen. The Prince of
Wales came about eleven o'clock. Mrs. Fitzherbert was also
present, but I could not distinguish her. But who is this lady?
methinks I hear you say. She is a lady to whom, against the
laws of the realm, the Prince of Wales is privately married, as is
universally believed. She appears with him in all public parties,
and he avows his marriage wherever he dares. They have been
the topic of conversation in all companies for a long time, and it
is now said that a young George may be expected in the course
of the summer. She was a widow of about thirty-two years of
age, whom he a long time persecuted in order to get her upon
his own terms; but finding he could not succeed, he quieted her
conscience by matrimony, which, however valid in the eye of
heaven, is set aside by the laws of the land, which forbids a
prince of the blood to marry a subject. As to dresses, I believe
I must leave them to be described to your sister. I am sorry I
have nothing better to send you than a sash and a Vandyke
ribbon. The narrow is to put round the edge of a hat, or you
may trim whatever you please with it.</p>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he gifts of expression and literary taste which have always
characterized the Adams family are most prominently represented
by this historian. He has also its great memory,
power of acquisition, intellectual independence, and energy of nature.
The latter is tempered in him with inherited self-control, the moderation
of judgment bred by wide historical knowledge, and a pervasive
atmosphere of literary good-breeding which constantly substitutes
allusive irony for crude statement, the rapier for the tomahawk.</p>

<p>Henry Adams is the third son of Charles Francis Adams, Sr.,--the
able Minister to England during the Civil War,--and grandson
of John Quincy Adams. He was born in Boston, February 16th, 1838,
graduated from Harvard in 1858, and served as private secretary to
his father in England. In 1870 he became editor of the North
American Review and Professor of History at Harvard, in which
place he won wide repute for originality and power of inspiring
enthusiasm for research in his pupils. He has written several essays
and books on historical subjects, and edited others,--'Essays on
Anglo-Saxon Law' (1876), 'Documents Relating to New England Federalism'
(1877), 'Albert Gallatin' (1879), 'Writings of Albert Gallatin'
(1879), 'John Randolph' (1882) in the 'American Statesmen' Series,
and 'Historical Essays'; but his great life-work and monument is his
'History of the United States, 1801-17' (the Jefferson and Madison
administrations), to write which he left his professorship in 1877, and
after passing many years in London, in other foreign capitals, in
Washington, and elsewhere, studying archives, family papers, published
works, shipyards, and many other things, in preparation for
it, published the first volume in 1889, and the last in 1891. It is in
nine volumes, of which the introductory chapters and the index make
up one.</p>

<p>The work in its inception (though not in its execution) is a
polemic tract--a family vindication, an act of pious duty; its sub-title
might be, 'A Justification of John Quincy Adams for Breaking
with the Federalist Party.' So taken, the reader who loves historical
fights and seriously desires truth should read the chapters on the
Hartford Convention and its preliminaries side by side with the
corresponding pages in Henry Cabot Lodge's 'Life of George Cabot.'
If he cannot judge from the pleadings of these two able advocates
with briefs for different sides, it is not for lack of full exposition.</p>

<p>But the 'History' is far more and higher than a piece of special
pleading. It is in the main, both as to domestic and international
matters, a resolutely cool and impartial presentation of facts and
judgments on all sides of a period where passionate partisanship lies
almost in the very essence of the questions--a tone contrasting oddly
with the political action and feeling of the two Presidents. Even
where, as toward the New England Federalists, many readers will
consider him unfair in his deductions, he never tampers with or
unfairly proportions the facts.</p>

<p>The work is a model of patient study, not alone of what is conventionally
accepted as historic material, but of all subsidiary matter
necessary to expert discussion of the problems involved. He goes
deeply into economic and social facts; he has instructed himself in
military science like a West Point student, in army needs like a quartermaster,
in naval construction, equipment, and management like
a naval officer. Of purely literary qualities, the history presents a
high order of constructive art in amassing minute details without
obscuring the main outlines; luminous statement; and the results of
a very powerful memory, which enables him to keep before his
vision every incident of the long chronicle with its involved groupings,
so that an armory of instructive comparisons, as well as of
polemic missiles, is constantly ready to his hand. He follows the
latest historical canons as to giving authorities.</p>

<p>The history advances many novel views, and controverts many
accepted facts. The relation of Napoleon's warfare against Hayti
and Toussaint to the great Continental struggle, and the position he
assigns it as the turning point of that greater contest, is perhaps
the most important of these. But almost as striking are his views
on the impressment problem and the provocations to the War of
1812; wherein he leads to the most unexpected deduction,--namely,
that the grievances on <i>both</i> sides were much greater than is generally
supposed. He shows that the profit and security of the American
merchant service drew thousands of English seamen into it, where
they changed their names and passed for American citizens, greatly
embarrassing English naval operations. On the other hand, he shows
that English outrages and insults were so gross that no nation with
spirit enough to be entitled to separate existence ought to have
endured them. He reverses the severe popular judgment on Madison
for consenting to the war--on the assumed ground of coveting
another term as President--which every other historian and biographer
from Hildreth to Sydney Howard Gay has pronounced, and
which has become a stock historical convention; holds Jackson's
campaign ending at New Orleans an imbecile undertaking redeemed
only by an act of instinctive pugnacity at the end; gives Scott and
Jacob Brown the honor they have never before received in fair
measure; and in many other points redistributes praise and blame
with entire independence, and with curious effect on many popular
ideas. His views on the Hartford Convention of 1814 are part of the
Federalist controversy already referred to.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_AUSPICES_OF_THE_WAR_OF_1812"></a>THE AUSPICES OF THE WAR OF 1812</h3>

<center>From 'History of the United States': 1890, by Charles
Scribner's Sons.</center>
<br>

<p>The American declaration of war against England, July 18th,
1812, annoyed those European nations that were gathering
their utmost resources for resistance to Napoleon's attack.
Russia could not but regard it as an unfriendly act, equally bad
for political and commercial interests. Spain and Portugal, whose
armies were fed largely if not chiefly on American grain imported
by British money under British protection, dreaded to see their
supplies cut off. Germany, waiting only for strength to recover
her freedom, had to reckon against one more element in Napoleon's
vast military resources. England needed to make greater
efforts in order to maintain the advantages she had gained in
Russia and Spain. Even in America no one doubted the earnestness
of England's wish for peace; and if Madison and Monroe
insisted on her acquiescence in their terms, they insisted because
they believed that their military position entitled them to expect
it. The reconquest of Russia and Spain by Napoleon, an event
almost certain to happen, could hardly fail to force from England
the concessions, not in themselves unreasonable, which the United
States required.</p>

<p>This was, as Madison to the end of his life maintained, &quot;a
fair calculation;&quot; but it was exasperating to England, who thought
that America ought to be equally interested with Europe in overthrowing
the military despotism of Napoleon, and should not conspire
with him for gain. At first the new war disconcerted the
feeble Ministry that remained in office on the death of Spencer
Perceval: they counted on preventing it, and did their utmost to
stop it after it was begun. The tone of arrogance which had so
long characterized government and press disappeared for the
moment. Obscure newspapers, like the London Evening Star, still
sneered at the idea that Great Britain was to be &quot;driven from
the proud pre-eminence which the blood and treasure of her sons
have attained for her among the nations, by a piece of striped
bunting flying at the mastheads of a few fir-built frigates, manned
by a handful of bastards and outlaws,&quot;--a phrase which had
great success in America,--but such defiances expressed a temper
studiously held in restraint previous to the moment when the war
was seen to be inevitable.</p>

<p>The realization that no escape could be found from an American
war was forced on the British public at a moment of much
discouragement. Almost simultaneously a series of misfortunes
occurred which brought the stoutest and most intelligent Englishmen
to the verge of despair. In Spain Wellington, after winning
the battle of Salamanca in July, occupied Madrid in August,
and obliged Soult to evacuate Andalusia; but his siege of Burgos
failed, and as the French generals concentrated their scattered
forces, Wellington was obliged to abandon Madrid once more.
October 21st he was again in full retreat on Portugal. The
apparent failure of his campaign was almost simultaneous with the
apparent success of Napoleon's; for the Emperor entered Moscow
September 14th, and the news of this triumph, probably decisive
of Russian submission, reached England about October 3d. Three
days later arrived intelligence of William Hull's surrender at
Detroit; but this success was counterbalanced by simultaneous
news of Isaac Hull's startling capture of the Guerri&egrave;re, and the
certainty of a prolonged war.</p>

<p>In the desponding condition of the British people,--with a deficient
harvest, bad weather, wheat at nearly five dollars a bushel,
and the American supply likely to be cut off; consols at 57 1/2,
gold at thirty per cent premium; a Ministry without credit or
authority, and a general consciousness of blunders, incompetence,
and corruption,--every new tale of disaster sank the hopes of
England and called out wails of despair. In that state of mind
the loss of the Guerri&egrave;re assumed portentous dimensions. The
Times was especially loud in lamenting the capture:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;We witnessed the gloom which that event cast over high and
honorable minds.... Never before in the history of the world
did an English frigate strike to an American; and though we cannot
say that Captain Dacres, under all circumstances, is punishable for
this act, yet we do say there are commanders in the English navy
who would a thousand times rather have gone down with their colors
flying, than have set their fellow sailors so fatal an example.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>No country newspaper in America, railing at Hull's cowardice
and treachery, showed less knowledge or judgment than the London
Times, which had written of nothing but war since its name
had been known in England. Any American could have assured
the English press that British frigates before the Guerri&egrave;re had
struck to American; and even in England men had not forgotten
the name of the British frigate Serapis, or that of the American
captain Paul Jones. Yet the Times's ignorance was less unreasonable
than its requirement that Dacres should have gone down
with his ship,--a cry of passion the more unjust to Dacres
because he fought his ship as long as she could float. Such
sensitiveness seemed extravagant in a society which had been
hardened by centuries of warfare; yet the Times reflected fairly
the feelings of Englishmen. George Canning, speaking in open
Parliament not long afterward, said that the loss of the Guerri&egrave;re
and the Macedonian produced a sensation in the country
scarcely to be equaled by the most violent convulsions of nature.
&quot;Neither can I agree with those who complain of the shock of
consternation throughout Great Britain as having been greater
than the occasion required.... It cannot be too deeply felt
that the sacred spell of the invincibility of the British navy was
broken by those unfortunate captures.&quot;</p>

<p>Of all spells that could be cast on a nation, that of believing
itself invincible was perhaps the one most profitably broken; but
the process of recovering its senses was agreeable to no nation,
and to England, at that moment of distress, it was as painful as
Canning described. The matter was not mended by the Courier
and Morning Post, who, taking their tone from the Admiralty,
complained of the enormous superiority of the American frigates,
and called them &quot;line-of-battle ships in disguise.&quot; Certainly the
American forty-four was a much heavier ship than the British
thirty-eight, but the difference had been as well known in the
British navy before these actions as it was afterward; and Captain
Dacres himself, the Englishman who best knew the relative
force of the ships, told his court of inquiry a different story:--&quot;I
am so well aware that the success of my opponent was owing
to fortune, that it is my earnest wish, and would be the happiest
period of my life, to be once more opposed to the Constitution,
with them [the old crew] under my command, in a frigate of
similar force with the Guerri&egrave;re.&quot; After all had been said, the
unpleasant result remained that in future, British frigates, like
other frigates, could safely fight only their inferiors in force.
What applied to the Guerri&egrave;re and Macedonian against the Constitution
and United States, where the British force was inferior,
applied equally to the Frolic against the Wasp, where no inferiority
could be shown. The British newspapers thenceforward
admitted what America wished to prove, that, ship for ship,
British were no more than the equals of Americans.</p>

<p>Society soon learned to take a more sensible view of the subject;
but as the first depression passed away, a consciousness of
personal wrong took its place. The United States were supposed
to have stabbed England in the back at the moment when her
hands were tied, when her existence was in the most deadly peril
and her anxieties were most heavy. England never could forgive
treason so base and cowardice so vile. That Madison had been
from the first a tool and accomplice of Bonaparte was thenceforward
so fixed an idea in British history that time could not
shake it. Indeed, so complicated and so historical had the causes
of war become that no one even in America could explain or
understand them, while Englishmen could see only that America
required England as the price of peace to destroy herself by
abandoning her naval power, and that England preferred to die
fighting rather than to die by her own hand. The American
party in England was extinguished; no further protest was heard
against the war; and the British people thought moodily of
revenge.</p>

<p>This result was unfortunate for both parties, but was doubly
unfortunate for America, because her mode of making the issue
told in her enemy's favor. The same impressions which silenced
in England open sympathy with America, stimulated in America
acute sympathy with England. Argument was useless against
people in a passion, convinced of their own injuries. Neither
Englishmen nor Federalists were open to reasoning. They found
their action easy from the moment they classed the United States
as an ally of France, like Bavaria or Saxony; and they had no
scruples of conscience, for the practical alliance was clear, and the
fact proved sufficiently the intent....</p>

<p>The loss of two or three thirty-eight-gun frigates on the
ocean was a matter of trifling consequence to the British government,
which had a force of four ships-of-the-line and six or eight
frigates in Chesapeake Bay alone, and which built every year
dozens of ships-of-the-line and frigates to replace those lost or
worn out; but although American privateers wrought more injury
to British interests than was caused or could be caused by
the American navy, the pride of England cared little about mercantile
losses, and cared immensely for its fighting reputation.
The theory that the American was a degenerate Englishman--a
theory chiefly due to American teachings--lay at the bottom of
British politics. Even the late British minister at Washington,
Foster, a man of average intelligence, thought it manifest good
taste and good sense to say of the Americans in his speech of
February 18th, 1813, in Parliament, that &quot;generally speaking,
they were not a people we should be proud to acknowledge as
our relations.&quot; Decatur and Hull were engaged in a social
rather than in a political contest, and were aware that the
serious work on their hands had little to do with England's
power, but much to do with her manners. The mortification of
England at the capture of her frigates was the measure of her
previous arrogance....</p>

<p>Every country must begin war by asserting that it will never
give way; and of all countries England, which had waged innumerable
wars, knew best when perseverance cost more than concession.
Even at that early moment Parliament was evidently
perplexed, and would willingly have yielded had it seen means of
escape from its naval fetich, impressment. Perhaps the perplexity
was more evident in the Commons than in the Lords; for Castlereagh,
while defending his own course with elaborate care, visibly
stumbled over the right of impressment. Even while claiming
that its abandonment would have been &quot;vitally dangerous if not
fatal&quot; to England's security, he added that he &quot;would be the
last man in the world to underrate the inconvenience which the
Americans sustained in consequence of our assertion of the right
of search.&quot; The embarrassment became still plainer when he
narrowed the question to one of statistics, and showed that the
whole contest was waged over the forcible retention of some
eight hundred seamen among one hundred and forty-five thousand
employed in British service. Granting the number were
twice as great, he continued, &quot;would the House believe that there
was any man so infatuated, or that the British empire was driven
to such straits that for such a paltry consideration as seventeen
hundred sailors, his Majesty's government would needlessly irritate
the pride of a neutral nation or violate that justice which
was due to one country from another?&quot; If Liverpool's argument
explained the causes of war, Castlereagh's explained its inevitable
result; for since the war must cost England at least 10,000,000
pounds a year, could Parliament be so infatuated as to pay 10,000
pounds a year for each American sailor detained in service, when
one-tenth of the amount, if employed in raising the wages of the
British sailor, would bring any required number of seamen back
to their ships? The whole British navy in 1812 cost 20,000,000
pounds; the pay-roll amounted to only 3,000,000 pounds; the
common sailor was paid four pounds bounty and eighteen pounds
a year, which might have been trebled at half the cost of an
American war.</p>

<h3><a name="WHAT_THE_WAR_OF_1812_DEMONSTRATED"></a>WHAT THE WAR OF 1812 DEMONSTRATED</h3>

<center>From 'History of the United States': 1890, by Charles
Scribner's Sons.</center>

<p>A people whose chief trait was antipathy to war, and to any
system organized with military energy, could scarcely develop
great results in national administration; yet the Americans
prided themselves chiefly on their political capacity. Even the
war did not undeceive them, although the incapacity brought into
evidence by the war was undisputed, and was most remarkable
among the communities which believed themselves to be most
gifted with political sagacity. Virginia and Massachusetts by turns
admitted failure in dealing with issues so simple that the newest
societies, like Tennessee and Ohio, understood them by instinct.
That incapacity in national politics should appear as a leading
trait in American character was unexpected by Americans, but
might naturally result from their conditions. The better test of
American character was not political but social, and was to be
found not in the government but in the people.</p>

<p>The sixteen years of Jefferson and Madison's rule furnished
international tests of popular intelligence upon which Americans
could depend. The ocean was the only open field for competition
among nations. Americans enjoyed there no natural or artificial
advantages over Englishmen, Frenchmen, or Spaniards; indeed,
all these countries possessed navies, resources, and experience
greater than were to be found in the United States. Yet the
Americans developed, in the course of twenty years, a surprising
degree of skill in naval affairs. The evidence of their success was
to be found nowhere so complete as in the avowals of Englishmen
who knew best the history of naval progress. The American
invention of the fast-sailing schooner or clipper was the more
remarkable because, of all American inventions, this alone sprang
from direct competition with Europe. During ten centuries of
struggle the nations of Europe had labored to obtain superiority
over each other in ship-construction; yet Americans instantly
made improvements which gave them superiority, and which
Europeans were unable immediately to imitate even after seeing
them. Not only were American vessels better in model, faster in
sailing, easier and quicker in handling, and more economical in
working than the European, but they were also better equipped.
The English complained as a grievance that the Americans
adopted new and unwarranted devices in naval warfare; that their
vessels were heavier and better constructed, and their missiles of
unusual shape and improper use. The Americans resorted to
expedients that had not been tried before, and excited a mixture
of irritation and respect in the English service, until &quot;Yankee
smartness&quot; became a national misdemeanor.</p>

<p>The English admitted themselves to be slow to change their
habits, but the French were both quick and scientific; yet Americans
did on the ocean what the French, under stronger inducements,
failed to do. The French privateer preyed upon British
commerce for twenty years without seriously injuring it; but no
sooner did the American privateer sail from French ports than
the rates of insurance doubled in London, and an outcry for protection
arose among English shippers which the Admiralty could
not calm. The British newspapers were filled with assertions
that the American cruiser was the superior of any vessel of its
class, and threatened to overthrow England's supremacy on the
ocean.</p>

<p>Another test of relative intelligence was furnished by the
battles at sea. Instantly after the loss of the Guerri&egrave;re the
English discovered and complained that American gunnery was
superior to their own. They explained their inferiority by the
length of time that had elapsed since their navy had found on
the ocean an enemy to fight. Every vestige of hostile fleets had
been swept away, until, after the battle of Trafalgar, British
frigates ceased practice with their guns. Doubtless the British
navy had become somewhat careless in the absence of a dangerous
enemy, but Englishmen were themselves aware that some
other cause must have affected their losses. Nothing showed that
Nelson's line-of-battle ships, frigates, or sloops were, as a rule,
better fought than the Macedonian and Java, the Avon and
Reindeer. Sir Howard Douglas, the chief authority on the
subject, attempted in vain to explain British reverses by the
deterioration of British gunnery. His analysis showed only that
American gunnery was extraordinarily good. Of all vessels, the
sloop-of-war--on account of its smallness, its quick motion, and
its more accurate armament of thirty-two-pound carronades--offered
the best test of relative gunnery, and Sir Howard Douglas
in commenting upon the destruction of the Peacock and Avon
could only say:--&quot;In these two actions it is clear that the fire of
the British vessels was thrown too high, and that the ordnance
of their opponents were expressly and carefully aimed at and
took effect chiefly in the hull.&quot;</p>

<p>The battle of the Hornet and Penguin, as well as those of
the Reindeer and Avon, showed that the excellence of American
gunnery continued till the close of the war. Whether at point-blank
range or at long-distance practice, the Americans used guns
as they had never been used at sea before.</p>

<p>None of the reports of former British victories showed that
the British fire had been more destructive at any previous time
than in 1812, and no report of any commander since the British
navy existed showed so much damage inflicted on an opponent in
so short a time as was proved to have been inflicted on themselves
by the reports of British commanders in the American
war. The strongest proof of American superiority was given by
the best British officers, like Broke, who strained every nerve to
maintain an equality with American gunnery. So instantaneous
and energetic was the effort that according to the British historian
of the war, &quot;A British forty-six-gun frigate of 1813 was half as
effective again as a British forty-six-gun frigate of 1812;&quot; and as
he justly said, &quot;the slaughtered crews and the shattered hulks&quot; of
the captured British ships proved that no want of their old fighting
qualities accounted for their repeated and almost habitual
mortifications.</p>

<p>Unwilling as the English were to admit the superior skill of
Americans on the ocean, they did not hesitate to admit it, in
certain respects, on land. The American rifle in American hands
was affirmed to have no equal in the world. This admission
could scarcely be withheld after the lists of killed and wounded
which followed almost every battle; but the admission served to
check a wider inquiry. In truth, the rifle played but a small part
in the war. Winchester's men at the river Raisin may have
owed their over-confidence, as the British Forty-first owed its
losses, to that weapon, and at New Orleans five or six hundred
of Coffee's men, who were out of range, were armed with the
rifle; but the surprising losses of the British were commonly due
to artillery and musketry fire. At New Orleans the artillery was
chiefly engaged. The artillery battle of January 1st, according to
British accounts, amply proved the superiority of American
gunnery on that occasion, which was probably the fairest test
during the war. The battle of January 8th was also chiefly an
artillery battle: the main British column never arrived within fair
musket range; Pakenham was killed by a grape-shot, and the
main column of his troops halted more than one hundred yards
from the parapet.</p>

<p>The best test of British and American military qualities, both
for men and weapons, was Scott's battle of Chippawa. Nothing
intervened to throw a doubt over the fairness of the trial. Two
parallel lines of regular soldiers, practically equal in numbers,
armed with similar weapons, moved in close order toward each
other across a wide, open plain, without cover or advantage of
position, stopping at intervals to load and fire, until one line
broke and retired. At the same time two three-gun batteries,
the British being the heavier, maintained a steady fire from positions
opposite each other. According to the reports, the two
infantry lines in the centre never came nearer than eighty yards.
Major-General Riall reported that then, owing to severe losses,
his troops broke and could not be rallied. Comparison of official
reports showed that the British lost in killed and wounded four
hundred and sixty-nine men; the Americans, two hundred and
ninety-six. Some doubts always affect the returns of wounded,
because the severity of the wound cannot be known; but dead
men tell their own tale. Riall reported one hundred and forty-eight
killed; Scott reported sixty-one. The severity of the losses
showed that the battle was sharply contested, and proved the
personal bravery of both armies. Marksmanship decided the result,
and the returns proved that the American fire was superior
to that of the British in the proportion of more than fifty per
cent, if estimated by the entire loss, and of two hundred and
forty-two to one hundred if estimated by the deaths alone.</p>

<p>The conclusion seemed incredible, but it was supported by the
results of the naval battles. The Americans showed superiority
amounting in some cases to twice the efficiency of their enemies
in the use of weapons. The best French critic of the naval war,
Jurien de la Gravi&egrave;re, said:--&quot;An enormous superiority in the
rapidity and precision of their fire can alone explain the difference
in the losses sustained by the combatants.&quot; So far from
denying this conclusion, the British press constantly alleged it,
and the British officers complained of it. The discovery caused
great surprise, and in both British services much attention was
at once directed to improvement in artillery and musketry. Nothing
could exceed the frankness with which Englishmen avowed
their inferiority. According to Sir Francis Head, &quot;gunnery was
in naval warfare in the extraordinary state of ignorance we have
just described, when our lean children, the American people,
taught us, rod in hand, our first lesson in the art.&quot; The English
text-book on Naval Gunnery, written by Major-General Sir Howard
Douglas immediately after the peace, devoted more attention
to the short American war than to all the battles of Napoleon,
and began by admitting that Great Britain had &quot;entered with too
great confidence on war with a marine much more expert than
that of any of our European enemies.&quot; The admission appeared
&quot;objectionable&quot; even to the author; but he did not add, what
was equally true, that it applied as well to the land as to the sea
service.</p>

<p>No one questioned the bravery of the British forces, or the
ease with which they often routed larger bodies of militia; but
the losses they inflicted were rarely as great as those they suffered.
Even at Bladensburg, where they met little resistance, their
loss was several times greater than that of the Americans. At
Plattsburg, where the intelligence and quickness of Macdonough
and his men alone won the victory, his ships were in effect stationary
batteries, and enjoyed the same superiority in gunnery.
&quot;The Saratoga,&quot; said his official report, &quot;had fifty-five round-shot
in her hull; the Confiance, one hundred and five. The enemy's
shot passed principally just over our heads, as there were not
twenty whole hammocks in the nettings at the close of the action.&quot;</p>

<p>The greater skill of the Americans was not due to special
training; for the British service was better trained in gunnery, as
in everything else, than the motley armies and fleets that fought
at New Orleans and on the Lakes. Critics constantly said that
every American had learned from his childhood the use of the
rifle; but he certainly had not learned to use cannon in shooting
birds or hunting deer, and he knew less than the Englishman
about the handling of artillery and muskets. The same intelligence
that selected the rifle and the long pivot-gun for favorite
weapons was shown in handling the carronade, and every other
instrument however clumsy.</p>

<p>Another significant result of the war was the sudden development
of scientific engineering in the United States. This branch
of the military service owed its efficiency and almost its existence
to the military school at West Point, established in 1802. The
school was at first much neglected by government. The number
of graduates before the year 1812 was very small; but at the
outbreak of the war the corps of engineers was already efficient.
Its chief was Colonel Joseph Gardner Swift, of Massachusetts,
the first graduate of the academy: Colonel Swift planned the
defenses of New York Harbor. The lieutenant-colonel in 1812
was Walker Keith Armistead, of Virginia,--the third graduate,
who planned the defenses of Norfolk. Major William McRee, of
North Carolina, became chief engineer to General Brown and
constructed the fortifications at Fort Erie, which cost the British
General Gordon Drummond the loss of half his army, besides the
mortification of defeat. Captain Eleazer Derby Wood, of New
York, constructed Fort Meigs, which enabled Harrison to defeat
the attack of Proctor in May, 1813. Captain Joseph Gilbert
Totten, of New York, was chief engineer to General Izard at
Plattsburg, where he directed the fortifications that stopped the
advance of Prevost's great army. None of the works constructed
by a graduate of West Point was captured by the enemy; and
had an engineer been employed at Washington by Armstrong
and Winder, the city would have been easily saved.</p>

<p>Perhaps without exaggeration the West Point Academy might
be said to have decided, next to the navy, the result of the war.
The works at New Orleans were simple in character, and as far
as they were due to engineering skill were directed by Major
Latour, a Frenchman; but the war was already ended when the
battle of New Orleans was fought. During the critical campaign
of 1814, the West Point engineers doubled the capacity of the
little American army for resistance, and introduced a new and
scientific character into American life.</p>

<center>From 'History of the United States': 1890, by Charles
Scribner's Sons.</center>

<p>As Broke's squadron swept along the coast it seized whatever
it met, and on July 16th caught one of President Jefferson's
sixteen-gun brigs, the Nautilus. The next day it came on
a richer prize. The American navy seemed ready to outstrip the
army in the race for disaster. The Constitution, the best frigate
in the United States service, sailed into the midst of Broke's five
ships. Captain Isaac Hull, in command of the Constitution, had
been detained at Annapolis shipping a new crew until July 5th,
the day when Broke's squadron left Halifax; then the ship got
under way and stood down Chesapeake Bay on her voyage to
New York. The wind was ahead and very light. Not until July
10th did the ship anchor off Cape Henry lighthouse, and not till
sunrise of July 12th did she stand to the eastward and northward.
Light head winds and a strong current delayed her progress till
July 17th, when at two o'clock in the afternoon, off Barnegat on
the New Jersey coast, the lookout at the masthead discovered
four sails to the northward, and two hours later a fifth sail to the
northeast. Hull took them for Rodgers's squadron. The wind
was light, and Hull being to windward determined to speak the
nearest vessel, the last to come in sight. The afternoon passed
without bringing the ships together, and at ten o'clock in the
evening, finding that the nearest ship could not answer the night
signal, Hull decided to lose no time in escaping.</p>

<p>Then followed one of the most exciting and sustained chases
recorded in naval history. At daybreak the next morning one
British frigate was astern within five or six miles, two more were
to leeward, and the rest of the fleet some ten miles astern, all
making chase. Hull put out his boats to tow the Constitution;
Broke summoned the boats of the squadron to tow the Shannon.
Hull then bent all his spare rope to the cables, dropped a small
anchor half a mile ahead, in twenty-six fathoms of water, and
warped his ship along. Broke quickly imitated the device, and
slowly gained on the chase. The Guerri&egrave;re crept so near Hull's
lee beam as to open fire, but her shot fell short. Fortunately the
wind, though slight, favored Hull. All night the British and
American crews toiled on, and when morning came the Belvidera,
proving to be the best sailer, got in advance of her consorts,
working two kedge anchors, until at two o'clock in the afternoon
she tried in her turn to reach the Constitution with her bow
guns, but in vain. Hull expected capture, but the Belvidera
could not approach nearer without bringing her boats under the
Constitution's stern guns; and the wearied crews toiled on, towing
and kedging, the ships barely out of gunshot, till another morning
came. The breeze, though still light, then allowed Hull to
take in his boats, the Belvidera being two and a half miles in his
wake, the Shannon three and a half miles on his lee, and the
three other frigates well to leeward. The wind freshened, and
the Constitution drew ahead, until, toward seven o'clock in the
evening of July 19th, a heavy rain squall struck the ship, and by
taking skillful advantage of it Hull left the Belvidera and Shannon
far astern; yet until eight o'clock the next morning they
were still in sight, keeping up the chase.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing during the war tested American seamanship
more thoroughly than these three days of combined skill and
endurance in the face of the irresistible enemy. The result
showed that Hull and the Constitution had nothing to fear in
these respects. There remained the question whether the superiority
extended to his guns; and such was the contempt of the
British naval officers for American ships, that with this expedience
before their eyes they still believed one of their thirty-eight-gun
frigates to be more than a match for an American forty-four,
although the American, besides the heavier armament, had proved
his capacity to outsail and out-manoeuvre the Englishman. Both
parties became more eager than ever for the test. For once, even
the Federalists of New England felt their blood stir; for their
own President and their own votes had called these frigates into
existence, and a victory won by the Constitution, which had been
built by their hands, was in their eyes a greater victory over
their political opponents than over the British. With no half-hearted
spirit the seagoing Bostonians showered well-weighed
praises on Hull when his ship entered Boston Harbor, July 26th,
after its narrow escape, and when he sailed again New England
waited with keen interest to learn his fate.</p>

<p>Hull could not expect to keep command of the Constitution.
Bainbridge was much his senior, and had the right to a preference
in active service. Bainbridge then held and was ordered to
retain command of the Constellation, fitting out at the Washington
Navy Yard; but Secretary Hamilton, July 28th, ordered
him to take command also of the Constitution on her arrival in
port. Doubtless Hull expected this change, and probably the
expectation induced him to risk a dangerous experiment; for
without bringing his ship to the Charlestown Navy Yard, but
remaining in the outer harbor, after obtaining such supplies as he
needed, August 2d, he set sail without orders, and stood to the
eastward. Having reached Cape Race without meeting an enemy,
he turned southward, until on the night of August 18th he spoke
a privateer, which told him of a British frigate near at hand.
Following the privateersman's directions, the Constitution the next
day, August 19th, [1812,] at two o'clock in the afternoon, latitude
41 deg. 42 min., longitude 55 deg. 48 min., sighted the Guerri&egrave;re.</p>

<p>The meeting was welcome on both sides. Only three days
before, Captain Dacres had entered on the log of a merchantman
a challenge to any American frigate to meet him off Sandy Hook.
Not only had the Guerri&egrave;re for a long time been extremely offensive
to every seafaring American, but the mistake which caused
the Little Belt to suffer so seriously for the misfortune of being
taken for the Guerri&egrave;re had caused a corresponding feeling of
anger in the officers of the British frigate. The meeting of August
19th had the character of a preconcerted duel.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing fresh from the northwest, with the sea
running high. Dacres backed his main topsail and waited. Hull
shortened sail, and ran down before the wind. For about an
hour the two ships wore and wore again, trying to get advantage
of position; until at last, a few minutes before six o'clock, they
came together side by side, within pistol shot, the wind almost
astern, and running before it, they pounded each other with all
their strength. As rapidly as the guns could be worked, the
Constitution poured in broadside after broadside, double-shotted
with round and grape; and without exaggeration, the echo of
these guns startled the world. &quot;In less than thirty minutes from
the time we got alongside of the enemy,&quot; reported Hull, &quot;she
was left without a spar standing, and the hull cut to pieces in
such a manner as to make it difficult to keep her above water.&quot;</p>

<p>That Dacres should have been defeated was not surprising;
that he should have expected to win was an example of British
arrogance that explained and excused the war. The length of the
Constitution was one hundred and seventy-three feet, that of the
Guerri&egrave;re was one hundred and fifty-six feet; the extreme breadth
of the Constitution was forty-four feet, that of the Guerri&egrave;re was
forty feet: or within a few inches in both cases. The Constitution
carried thirty-two long twenty-four-pounders, the Guerri&egrave;re
thirty long eighteen-pounders and two long twelve-pounders;
the Constitution carried twenty thirty-two-pound carronades, the
Guerri&egrave;re sixteen. In every respect, and in proportion of ten to
seven, the Constitution was the better ship; her crew was more
numerous in proportion of ten to six. Dacres knew this very
nearly as well as it was known to Hull, yet he sought a duel.
What he did not know was that in a still greater proportion
the American officers and crew were better and more intelligent
seamen than the British, and that their passionate wish to repay
old scores gave them extraordinary energy. So much greater
was the moral superiority than the physical, that while the
Guerri&egrave;re's force counted as seven against ten, her losses counted
as though her force were only two against ten.</p>

<p>Dacres's error cost him dear; for among the Guerri&egrave;re's crew
of two hundred and seventy-two, seventy-nine were killed or
wounded, and the ship was injured beyond saving before Dacres
realized his mistake, although he needed only thirty minutes of
close fighting for the purpose. He never fully understood the
causes of his defeat, and never excused it by pleading, as he
might have done, the great superiority of his enemy.</p>

<p>Hull took his prisoners on board the Constitution, and after
blowing up the Guerri&egrave;re sailed for Boston, where he arrived on
the morning of August 30th. The Sunday silence of the Puritan
city broke into excitement as the news passed through the quiet
streets that the Constitution was below in the outer harbor with
Dacres and his crew prisoners on board. No experience of history
ever went to the heart of New England more directly than
this victory, so peculiarly its own: but the delight was not confined
to New England, and extreme though it seemed, it was still not
extravagant; for however small the affair might appear on the
general scale of the world's battles, it raised the United States
in one half-hour to the rank of a first class Power in the world.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_ADAMS"></a>JOHN ADAMS</h2>

<h3>(1735-1826)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ohn Adams, second President of the United States, was born
at Braintree, Mass., October 19th, 1735, and died there July
4th, 1826, the year after his son too was inaugurated President.
He was the first conspicuous member of an enduringly powerful
and individual family. The Adams race have mostly been
vehement, proud, pugnacious, and independent, with hot tempers and
strong wills; but with high ideals, dramatic devotion to duty, and the
intense democratic sentiment so often found united with personal
aristocracy of feeling. They have been men of affairs first, with large
practical ability, but with a deep strain of the man of letters which
in this generation has outshone the other faculties; strong-headed and
hard-working students, with powerful memories and fluent gifts of
expression.</p>

<br>
<a name="135.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/135.jpg" width="45%" alt="">
</p><br>

<p>All these characteristics went to make up John Adams; but their
enumeration does not furnish a complete picture of him, or reveal the
virile, choleric, masterful man. And he was far more lovable and far
more popular than his equally great son, also a typical Adams, from
the same cause which produced some of his worst blunders and
misfortunes,--a generous impulsiveness of feeling which made it
impossible for him to hold his tongue at the wrong time and place for
talking. But so fervid, combative, and opinionated a man was sure
to gain much more hate than love; because love results from comprehension,
which only the few close to him could have, while hate--toward
an honest man--is the outcome of ignorance, which most of
the world cannot avoid. Admiration and respect, however, he had
from the majority of his party at the worst of times; and the best
encomium on him is that the closer his public acts are examined, the
more credit they reflect not only on his abilities but on his
unselfishness.</p>

<p>Born of a line of Massachusetts farmers, he graduated from Harvard
in 1755. After teaching a grammar school and beginning to read
theology, he studied law and began practice in 1758, soon becoming
a leader at the bar and in public life. In 1764 he married the noble
and delightful woman whose letters furnish unconscious testimony to
his lovable qualities. All through the germinal years of the Revolution
he was one of the foremost patriots, steadily opposing any
abandonment or compromise of essential rights. In 1765 he was
counsel for Boston with Otis and Gridley to support the town's
memorial against the Stamp Act. In 1766 he was selectman. In 1768
the royal government offered him the post of advocate-general in the
Court of Admiralty,--a lucrative bribe to desert the opposition; but
he refused it. Yet in 1770, as a matter of high professional duty, he
became counsel (successfully) for the British soldiers on trial for the
&quot;Boston Massacre.&quot; Though there was a present uproar of abuse,
Mr. Adams was shortly after elected Representative to the General
Court by more than three to one. In March, 1774, he contemplated
writing the &quot;History of the Contest between Britain and America!&quot;
On June 17th he presided over the meeting at Faneuil Hall to consider
the Boston Port Bill, and at the same hour was elected Representative
to the first Congress at Philadelphia (September 1) by the
Provincial Assembly held in defiance of the government. Returning
thence, he engaged in newspaper debate on the political issues till
the battle of Lexington.</p>

<p>Shortly after, he again journeyed to Philadelphia to the Congress
of May 5th, 1775; where he did on his own motion, to the disgust
of his Northern associates and the reluctance even of the Southerners,
one of the most important and decisive acts of the Revolution,--induced
Congress to adopt the forces in New England as a national
army and put George Washington of Virginia at its head, thus
engaging the Southern colonies irrevocably in the war and securing
the one man who could make it a success. In 1776 he was a chief
agent in carrying a declaration of independence. He remained in
Congress till November, 1777, as head of the War Department, very
useful and laborious though making one dreadful mistake: he was
largely responsible for the disastrous policy of ignoring the just
claims and decent dignity of the military commanders, which lost the
country some of its best officers and led directly to Arnold's treason.
His reasons, exactly contrary to his wont, were good abstract logic
but thorough practical nonsense.</p>

<p>In December, 1777, he was appointed commissioner to France to
succeed Silas Deane, and after being chased by an English man-of-war
(which he wanted to fight) arrived at Paris in safety. There
he reformed a very bad state of affairs; but thinking it absurd to
keep three envoys at one court (Dr. Franklin and Arthur Lee were
there before him), he induced Congress to abolish his office, and
returned in 1779. Chosen a delegate to the Massachusetts constitutional
convention, he was called away from it to be sent again to
France. There he remained as Franklin's colleague, detesting and
distrusting him and the French foreign minister, Vergennes, embroiling
himself with both and earning a cordial return of his warmest
dislike from both, till July, 1780. He then went to Holland as volunteer
minister, and in 1782 was formally recognized as from an independent
nation. Meantime Vergennes intrigued with all his might to
have Adams recalled, and actually succeeded in so tying his hands
that half the advantages of independence would have been lost but
for his contumacious persistence. In the final negotiations for peace,
he persisted against his instructions in making the New England fisheries
an ultimatum, and saved them. In 1783 he was commissioned
to negotiate a commercial treaty with Great Britain, and in 1785 was
made minister to that power. The wretched state of American affairs
under the Confederation made it impossible to obtain any advantages
for his country, and the vindictive feeling of the English made his
life a purgatory, so that he was glad to come home in 1788.</p>

<p>In the first Presidential election of that year he was elected
Vice-President on the ticket with Washington; and began a feud with
Alexander Hamilton, the mighty leader of the Federalist party and
chief organizer of our governmental machine, which ended in the
overthrow of the party years before its time, and had momentous
personal and literary results as well. He was as good a Federalist
as Hamilton, and felt as much right to be leader if he could; Hamilton
would not surrender his leadership, and the rivalry never ended
till Hamilton's murder. In 1796 he was elected President against
Jefferson. His Presidency is recognized as one of the ablest and most
useful on the roll; but its personal memoirs are most painful and
scandalous. The cabinet were nearly all Hamiltonians, regularly laid
all the official secrets before Hamilton, and took advice from him to
thwart the President. They disliked Mr. Adams's overbearing ways
and obtrusive vanity, considered his policy destructive to the party
and injurious to the country, and felt that loyalty to these involved
and justified disloyalty to him. Finally his best act brought on an
explosion. The French Directory had provoked a war with this country,
which the Hamiltonian section of the leaders and much of the
party hailed with delight; but showing signs of a better spirit, Mr.
Adams, without consulting his Cabinet, who he knew would oppose it
almost or quite unanimously, nominated a commission to frame a
treaty with France. The storm of fury that broke on him from his
party has rarely been surpassed, even in the case of traitors outright,
and he was charged with being little better. He was renominated
for President in 1800, but beaten by Jefferson, owing to the defections
in his own party, largely of Hamilton's producing. The Federalist
party never won another election; the Hamilton section laid its death
to Mr. Adams, and American history is hot with the fires of this
battle even yet.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams's later years were spent at home, where he was always
interested in public affairs and sometimes much too free in comments
on them; where he read immensely and wrote somewhat. He
heartily approved his son's break with the Federalists on the Embargo.
He died on the same day as Jefferson, both on the fiftieth
anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>As a writer, Mr. Adams's powers show best in the work which
can hardly be classed as literature,--his forcible and bitter political
letters, diatribes, and polemics. As in his life, his merits and defects
not only lie side by side, but spring from the same source,--his
vehemence, self-confidence, and impatience of obstruction. He writes
impetuously because he feels impetuously. With little literary grace,
he possesses the charm that belongs to clear and energetic thought
and sense transfused with hot emotion. John Fiske goes so far as to
say that &quot;as a writer of English, John Adams in many respects surpassed
all his American contemporaries.&quot; He was by no means without
humor,--a characteristic which shows in some of his portraits,--and
sometimes realized the humorous aspects of his own intense and
exaggerative temperament. His remark about Timothy Pickering,
that &quot;under the simple appearance of a bald head and straight hair,
he conceals the most ambitious designs,&quot; is perfectly self-conscious in
its quaint naivet&eacute;.</p>

<p>His 'Life and Works,' edited by his grandson, Charles Francis
Adams, Sr., in ten volumes, is the great storehouse of his writings.
The best popular account of his life is by John T. Morse, Jr., in the
'American Statesmen' series.</p>

<h3><a name="AT_THE_FRENCH_COURT"></a>AT THE FRENCH COURT</h3>
<center>From his Diary, June 7th, 1778, with his later comments in brackets.</center>

<p>Went to Versailles, in company with Mr. Lee, Mr. Izard
and his lady, Mr. Lloyd and his lady, and Mr. Fran&ccedil;ois.
Saw the grand procession of the Knights <i>du Saint-Esprit</i>,
or <i>du Cordon Bleu</i>. At nine o'clock at night, went to the <i>grand
convert</i>, and saw the king, queen, and royal family, at supper;
had a fine seat and situation close by the royal family, and had
a distinct and full view of the royal pair.</p>

<p>[Our objects were to see the ceremonies of the knights, and
in the evening the public supper of the royal family. The
kneelings, the bows, and the courtesies of the knights, the
dresses and decorations, the king seated on his throne, his
investiture of a new created knight with the badges and ornaments
of the order, and his majesty's profound and reverential
bow before the altar as he retired, were novelties and curiosities
to me, but surprised me much less than the patience and perseverance
with which they all kneeled, for two hours together,
upon the hard marble of which the floor of the chapel was made.
The distinction of the blue ribbon was very dearly purchased at
the price of enduring this painful operation four times in a year,
The Count de Vergennes confessed to me that he was almost
dead with the pain of it. And the only insinuation I ever heard,
that the king was in any degree touched by the philosophy of
the age, was, that he never discovered so much impatience,
under any of the occurrences of his life, as in going through
those tedious ceremonies of religion, to which so many hours of
his life were condemned by the catholic church.</p>

<p>The queen was attended by her ladies to the gallery opposite
to the altar, placed in the centre of the seat, and there left alone
by the other ladies, who all retired. She was an object too
sublime and beautiful for my dull pen to describe. I leave this
enterprise to Mr. Burke. But in his description, there is more
of the orator than of the philosopher. Her dress was everything
that art and wealth could make it. One of the maids of honor
told me she had diamonds upon her person to the value of
eighteen millions of livres; and I always thought her majesty
much beholden to her dress. Mr. Burke saw her probably but
once. I have seen her fifty times perhaps, and in all the varieties
of her dresses. She had a fine complexion, indicating
perfect health, and was a handsome woman in her face and
figure. But I have seen beauties much superior, both in countenance
and form, in France, England, and America.</p>

<p>After the ceremonies of this institution are over, there is a
collection for the poor; and that this closing scene may be as
elegant as any of the former, a young lady of some of the first
families in France is appointed to present the box to the knights.
Her dress must be as rich and elegant, in proportion, as the
Queen's, and her hair, motions, and curtsies must have as much
dignity and grace as those of the knights. It was a curious
entertainment to observe the easy air, the graceful bow, and the
conscious dignity of the knight, in presenting his contribution;
and the corresponding ease, grace, and dignity of the lady, in
receiving it, were not less charming. Every muscle, nerve, and
fibre of both seemed perfectly disciplined to perform its functions.
The elevation of the arm, the bend of the elbow, and
every finger in the hand of the knight, in putting his louis d'ors
into the box appeared to be perfectly studied, because it was
perfectly natural. How much devotion there was in all this I
know not, but it was a consummate school to teach the rising
generation the perfection of the French air, and external politeness
and good-breeding. I have seen nothing to be compared
to it in any other country....</p>

<p>At nine o'clock we went and saw the king, queen, and royal
family, at the <i>grand couvert</i>. Whether M. Fran&ccedil;ois, a gentleman
who undertook upon this occasion to conduct us, had contrived a
plot to gratify the curiosity of the spectators, or whether the
royal family had a fancy to see the raw American at their
leisure, or whether they were willing to gratify him with a convenient
seat, in which he might see all the royal family, and all
the splendors of the place, I know not; but the scheme could
not have been carried into execution, certainly, without the
orders of the king. I was selected, and summoned indeed, from
all my company, and ordered to a seat close beside the royal
family. The seats on both sides of the hall, arranged like the
seats in a theatre, were all full of ladies of the first rank and
fashion in the kingdom, and there was no room or place for me
but in the midst of them. It was not easy to make room for
one more person. However, room was made, and I was situated
between two ladies, with rows and ranks of ladies above and
below me, and on the right hand and on the left, and ladies
only. My dress was a decent French dress, becoming the station
I held, but not to be compared with the gold, and diamonds,
and embroidery, about me. I could neither speak nor understand
the language in a manner to support a conversation, but I
had soon the satisfaction to find it was a silent meeting, and
that nobody spoke a word but the royal family to each other,
and they said very little. The eyes of all the assembly were
turned upon me, and I felt sufficiently humble and mortified, for
I was not a proper object for the criticisms of such a company.
I found myself gazed at, as we in America used to gaze at the
sachems who came to make speeches to us in Congress; but I
thought it very hard if I could not command as much power of
face as one of the chiefs of the Six Nations, and therefore determined
that I would assume a cheerful countenance, enjoy the
scene around me, and observe it as coolly as an astronomer contemplates
the stars. Inscriptions of <i>Fructus Belli</i> were seen on
the ceiling and all about the walls of the room, among paintings
of the trophies of war; probably done by the order of
Louis XIV., who confessed in his dying hour, as his successor
and exemplar Napoleon will probably do, that he had been too
fond of war. The king was the royal carver for himself and all
his family. His majesty ate like a king, and made a royal
supper of solid beef, and other things in proportion. The queen
took a large spoonful of soup, and displayed her fine person and
graceful manners, in alternately looking at the company in various
parts of the hall, and ordering several kinds of seasoning to
be brought to her, by which she fitted her supper to her taste.]</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="THE_CHARACTER_OF_FRANKLIN"></a>THE CHARACTER OF FRANKLIN</h3>

<center>From Letter to the Boston Patriot, May 15th, 1811</center>

<p>Franklin had a great genius, original, sagacious, and inventive,
capable of discoveries in science no less than of improvements
in the fine arts and the mechanic arts. He had a
vast imagination, equal to the comprehension of the greatest
objects, and capable of a cool and steady comprehension of them.
He had wit at will. He had humor that when he pleased was
delicate and delightful. He had a satire that was good-natured
or caustic, Horace or Juvenal, Swift or Rabelais, at his pleasure.
He had talents for irony, allegory, and fable, that he could adapt
with great skill to the promotion of moral and political truth.
He was master of that infantine simplicity which the French call
<i>naivet&eacute;</i> which never fails to charm in Phaedrus and La Fontaine,
from the cradle to the grave. Had he been blessed with the
same advantages of scholastic education in his early youth, and
pursued a course of studies as unembarrassed with occupations
of public and private life as Sir Isaac Newton, he might have
emulated the first philosopher. Although I am not ignorant that
most of his positions and hypotheses have been controverted, I
cannot but think he has added much to the mass of natural
knowledge, and contributed largely to the progress of the human
mind, both by his own writings and by the controversies and
experiments he has excited in all parts of Europe. He had abilities
for investigating statistical questions, and in some parts of
his life has written pamphlets and essays upon public topics with
great ingenuity and success; but after my acquaintance with him,
which commenced in Congress in 1775, his excellence as a legislator,
a politician, or a negotiator most certainly never appeared.
No sentiment more weak and superficial was ever avowed by the
most absurd philosopher than some of his, particularly one that
he procured to be inserted in the first constitution of Pennsylvania,
and for which he had such a fondness as to insert it in
his will. I call it weak, for so it must have been, or hypocritical;
unless he meant by one satiric touch to ridicule his own republic,
or throw it into everlasting contempt.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge, after all, that nothing in life has mortified
or grieved me more than the necessity which compelled me
to oppose him so often as I have. He was a man with whom I
always wished to live in friendship, and for that purpose omitted
no demonstration of respect, esteem, and veneration in my power,
until I had unequivocal proofs of his hatred, for no other reason
under the sun but because I gave my judgment in opposition to
his in many points which materially affected the interests of our
country, and in many more which essentially concerned our
happiness, safety, and well-being. I could not and would not
sacrifice the clearest dictates of my understanding and the purest
principles of morals and policy in compliance to Dr. Franklin.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_QUINCY_ADAMS"></a>JOHN QUINCY ADAMS</h2>

<h3>(1767-1848)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he chief distinction in character between John Adams and
his son is the strangest one imaginable, when one remembers
that to the fiery, combative, bristling Adams blood was
added an equal strain from the gay, genial, affectionate Abigail Smith.
The son, though of deep inner affections, and even hungering for good-will
if it would come without his help, was on the surface incomparably
colder, harsher, and thornier than his father, with all the
socially repellent traits of the race and none of the softer ones. The
father could never control his tongue or his temper, and not always
his head; the son never lost the bridle of either, and much of his terrible
power in debate came from his ability to make others lose
theirs while perfectly keeping his own. The father had plenty of
warm friends and allies,--at the worst he worked with half a party;
the son in the most superb part of his career had no friends, no
allies, no party except the group of constituents who kept him in
Congress. The father's self-confidence deepened in the son to a solitary
and even contemptuous gladiatorship against the entire government
of the country, for long years of hate and peril. The father's
irritable though generous vanity changed in the son to an icy
contempt or white-hot scorn of nearly all around him. The father's
spasms of acrimonious judgment steadied in the son to a constant
rancor always finding new objects. But only John Quincy Adams
could have done the work awaiting John Quincy Adams, and each of
his unamiable qualities strengthened his fibre to do it. And if a
man is to be judged by his fruits, Mr. Morse is justified in saying
that he was &quot;not only pre-eminent in ability and acquirements, but
even more to be honored for profound, immutable honesty of purpose,
and broad, noble humanity of aims.&quot;</p>

<p>It might almost be said that the sixth President of the United
States was cradled in statesmanship. Born July 11th, 1767, he was a
little lad of ten when he accompanied his father on the French mission.
Eighteen months elapsed before he returned, and three months
later he was again upon the water, bound once more for the French
capital. There were school days in Paris, and other school days in
Amsterdam and in Leyden; but the boy was only fourteen,--the mature
old child!--when he went to St. Petersburg as private secretary
and interpreter to Francis Dana, just appointed minister plenipotentiary
to the court of the Empress Catherine. Such was his apprenticeship
to a public career which began in earnest in 1794, and lasted,
with slight interruptions, for fifty-four years. Minister to the United
Netherlands, to Russia, to Prussia, and to England; commissioner to
frame the Treaty of Ghent which ended the war of 1812; State Senator,
United States Senator; Secretary of State, a position in which
he made the treaty with Spain which conceded Florida, and enunciated
the Monroe Doctrine before Monroe and far more thoroughly
than he; President, and then for many years Member of the National
House of Representatives,--it is strange to find this man writing in
his later years, &quot;My whole life has been a succession of disappointments.
I can scarcely recollect a single instance of success to anything
that I ever undertook.&quot;</p>

<p>It is true, however, that his successes and even his glories always
had some bitter ingredient to spoil their flavor. As United States
Senator he was practically &quot;boycotted&quot; for years, even by his own
party members, because he was an Adams. In 1807 he definitely
broke with the Federalist party--for what he regarded as its slavish
crouching under English outrages, conduct which had been for years
estranging him--by supporting Jefferson's Embargo, as better than
no show of resistance at all; and was for a generation denounced by
the New England Federalists as a renegade for the sake of office and
a traitor to New England. The Massachusetts Legislature practically
censured him in 1808, and he resigned.</p>

<p>His winning of the Presidency brought pain instead of pleasure:
he valued it only as a token of national confidence, got it only as
a minority candidate in a divided party, and was denounced by the
Jacksonians as a corrupt political bargainer. And his later Congressional
career, though his chief title to glory, was one long martyrdom
(even though its worst pains were self-inflicted), and he never knew
the immense victory he had actually won. The &quot;old man eloquent,&quot;
after ceasing to be President, was elected in 1830 by his home
district a Representative in Congress, and regularly re-elected till his
death. For a long time he bore the anti-slavery standard almost
alone in the halls of Congress, a unique and picturesque figure, rousing
every demon of hatred in his fellow-members, in constant and
envenomed battle with them, and more than a match for them all.
He fought single-handed for the right of petition as an indefeasible
right, not hesitating to submit a petition from citizens of Virginia
praying for his own expulsion from Congress as a nuisance. In 1836
he presented a petition from one hundred and fifty-eight ladies,
citizens of Massachusetts, &quot;for, I said, I had not yet brought myself
to doubt whether females were citizens.&quot; After eight years of persistent
struggle against the &quot;Atherton gag law,&quot; which practically
denied the right of petition in matters relating to slavery, he carried
a vote rescinding it, and nothing of the kind was again enacted. He
had a fatal stroke of paralysis on the floor of Congress February
21st, 1848, and died two days later.</p>

<p>As a writer he was perspicuous, vigorous, and straightforward.
He had entered Harvard in the middle of the college course, and
been graduated with honors. He had then studied and practiced
law. He was Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard from
1806 to 1809, and was well drilled in the use of language, but was
too downright in his temper and purposes to spend much labor upon
artistic effects. He kept an elaborate diary during the greater part
of his life,--since published in twelve volumes of &quot;Memoirs&quot; by
his son Charles Francis Adams; a vast storehouse of material relating
to the political history of the country, but, as published, largely
restricted to public affairs. He delivered orations on Lafayette, on
Madison, on Monroe, on Independence, and on the Constitution; published
essays on the Masonic Institution and various other matters;
a report on weights and measures, of enormous labor and permanent
value; Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory; a tale in verse on the Conquest
of Ireland, with the title 'Dermot MacMorrogh'; an account of
Travels in Silesia; and a volume of 'Poems of Religion and Society.'
He had some facility in rhyme, but his judgment was not at fault in
informing him that he was not a poet. Mr. Morse says that &quot;No
man can have been more utterly void of a sense of humor or an
appreciation of wit&quot;; and yet he very fairly anticipated Holmes in
his poem on 'The Wants of Man,' and hits rather neatly a familiar
foible in the verse with which he begins 'Dermot MacMorrogh':--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;'Tis strange how often readers will indulge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their wits a mystic meaning to discover;<br>
Secrets ne'er dreamt of by the bard divulge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And where he shoots a cluck, will find a plover;<br>
Satiric shafts from every line promulge,<br>

<center>(At the Age of Ten)</center>

<p>DEAR SIR,--I love to receive letters very well; much better than
I love to write them. I make but a poor figure at composition,
my head is too fickle, my thoughts are running after
birds eggs play and trifles, till I get vexed with myself. Mamma
has a troublesome task to keep me steady, and I own I am
ashamed of myself. I have but just entered the third volume of
Smollett, tho' I had designed to have got it half through by this
time. I have determined this week to be more diligent, as Mr.
Thaxter will be absent at Court, and I cannot pursue my other
studies. I have Set myself a Stent and determine to read the 3rd
volume Half out. If I can but keep my resolution, I will write
again at the end of the week and give a better account of myself.
I wish, Sir, you would give me some instructions, with regard to
my time, and advise me how to proportion my Studies and my
Play, in writing, and I will keep them by me, and endeavor to
follow them. I am, dear Sir, with a present determination of
growing better, yours.</p>

<p>P.S.--Sir, if you will be so good as to favor me with a Blank
Book, I will transcribe the most remarkable occurances I meet
with in my reading, which will serve to fix them upon my mind.</p>

<p>April 26th, 1785.--A letter from Mr. Gerry of Feb. 25th Says
that Mr. Adams is appointed Minister to the Court of
London.</p>

<p>I believe he will promote the interests of the United States,
as much as any man, but I fear his duty will induce him to make
exertions which may be detrimental to his health. I wish however
it may be otherwise. Were I now to go with him, probably
my immediate satisfaction might be greater than it will be in
returning to America. After having been traveling for these
seven years almost all over Europe, and having been in the
World, and among company, for three; to return to spend one
or two years in the pale of a College, subjected to all the rules
which I have so long been freed from; then to plunge into the
dry and tedious study of the Law for three years; and afterwards
not expect (however good an opinion I may have of myself) to
bring myself into notice under three or four years more; if ever!
It is really a prospect somewhat discouraging for a youth of my
ambition (for I have ambition, though I hope its object is laudable).
But still</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Oh! how wretched<br>
Is that poor Man, that hangs on Princes' favors&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>or on those of anybody else. I am determined that so long as I
shall be able to get my own living in an honorable manner, I
will depend upon no one. My Father has been so much taken up
all his lifetime with the interests of the public, that his own fortune
has suffered by it; so that his children will have to provide
for themselves, which I shall never be able to do, if I loiter away
my precious time in Europe and shun going home until I am
forced to it. With an ordinary share of Common sense which I
hope I enjoy, at least in America I can live <i>independent</i> and <i>free</i>;
and rather than live otherwise I would wish to die before the
time when I shall be left at my own discretion. I have before
me a striking example of the distressing and humiliating situation
a person is reduced to by adopting a different line of conduct,
and I am determined not to fall into the same error.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_THE_MEMOIRS_2"></a>FROM THE MEMOIRS</h3>

<p>JANUARY 14TH, 1831.--I received a letter from John C. Calhoun,
now Vice-President of the United States, relating to his present
controversy with President Jackson and William H. Crawford.
He questions me concerning the letter of General Jackson
to Mr. Monroe which Crawford alleges to have been produced at
the Cabinet meetings on the Seminole War, and asks for copies,
if I think proper to give them, of Crawford's letter to me which
I received last summer, and of my answer. I answered Mr. Calhoun's
letter immediately, rigorously confining myself to the direct
object of his inquiries. This is a new bursting out of the old and
rancorous feud between Crawford and Calhoun, both parties to
which, after suspending their animosities and combining together
to effect my ruin, are appealing to me for testimony to sustain
themselves each against the other. This is one of the occasions
upon which I shall eminently need the direction of a higher power
to guide me in every step of my conduct. I see my duty to discard
all consideration of their treatment of me; to adhere, in
everything that I shall say or write, to the truth; to assert nothing
positively of which I am not absolutely certain; to deny
nothing upon which there remains a scruple of doubt upon my
memory; to conceal nothing which it may be lawful to divulge,
and which may promote truth and justice between the parties.
With these principles, I see further the necessity for caution and
prudence in the course I shall take. The bitter enmity of all
three of the parties--Jackson, Calhoun, and Crawford--against
me, an enmity the more virulent because kindled by their own
ingratitude and injustice to me; the interest which every one of
them, and all their partisans, have in keeping up that load
of obloquy and public odium which their foul calumnies have
brought down upon me; and the disfavor in which I stand before
a majority of the people, excited against me by their artifices;--their
demerits to me are proportioned to the obligations to me--Jackson's
the greatest, Crawford's the next, Calhoun's the least of
positive obligation, but darkened by his double-faced setting himself
up as a candidate for the Presidency against me in 1821, his
prevarications between Jackson and me in 1824, and his icy-hearted
dereliction of all the decencies of social intercourse with
me, solely from the terror of Jackson, since the 4th of March,
1829. I walk between burning ploughshares; let me be mindful
where I place my foot.</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="FROM_THE_MEMOIRS_3"></a>FROM THE MEMOIRS</h3>

<p>JUNE 7TH, 1833.--The first seedling apple-tree that I had observed
on my return here just out of the ground was on the 22d
of April. It had grown slowly but constantly since, and had
put out five or six leaves. Last evening, after my return from
Boston, I saw it perfectly sound. This morning I found it broken
off, leaving one lobe of the seed-leaves, and one leaf over it. This
may have been the work of a bug, or perhaps of a caterpillar. It
would not be imaginable to any person free from hobby-horse or
fanciful attachments, how much mortification such an incident occasions.
St. Evremond, after removing into the country, returned
to a city life because he found himself in despair for the loss of
a pigeon. His conclusion was, that rural life induced exorbitant
attachment to insignificant objects. My experience is conformable
to this. My natural propensity was to raise trees, fruit and forest,
from the seed. I had it in early youth, but the course of my life
deprived me of the means of pursuing the bent of my inclination.
One shellbark-walnut-tree in my garden, the root of which
I planted 8th October, 1804, and one Mazzard cherry-tree in the
grounds north of the house, the stone of which I planted about
the same time, are the only remains of my experiments of so
ancient a date. Had my life been spent in the country, and my
experiments commenced while I was at College, I should now
have a large fruit garden, flourishing orchards of native fruit, and
very valuable forests; instead of which I have a nursery of about
half an acre of ground, half full of seedlings, from five years to
five days old, bearing for the first time perhaps twenty peaches,
and a few blossoms of apricots and cherries; and hundreds of
seedlings of the present year perishing from day to day before my
eyes.</p>

<p>SEPTEMBER 9TH, 1833.--Cold and cloudy day, clearing off toward
evening. In the multitudinous whimseys of a disabled mind
and body, the thick-coming fancies often come to me that
the events which affect my life and adventures are specially
shaped to disappoint my purposes. My whole life has been a
succession of disappointments. I can scarcely recollect a single
instance of success to anything that I ever undertook. Yet, with
fervent gratitude to God, I confess that my life has been equally
marked by great and signal successes which I neither aimed at
nor anticipated. Fortune, by which I understand Providence, has
showered blessings upon me profusely. But they have been
blessings unforeseen and unsought. &quot;Non nobis Domine, non
nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam!&quot; I ought to have been taught
by it three lessons:--1. Of implicit reliance upon Providence.
2. Of humility and humiliation; the thorough conviction of my
own impotence to accomplish anything. 3. Of resignation; and
not to set my heart upon anything which can be taken from me
or denied.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_MISSION_OF_AMERICA"></a>THE MISSION OF AMERICA</h3>

<center>From his Fourth of July Oration at Washington, 1821</center>

<p>And now, friends and countrymen, if the wise and learned
philosophers of the older world, the first observers of nutation
and aberration, the discoverers of maddening ether and
invisible planets, the inventors of Congreve rockets and shrapnel
shells, should find their hearts disposed to inquire, What has
America done for mankind? let our answer be this:--America,
with the same voice which spoke herself into existence as a
nation, proclaimed to mankind the inextinguishable rights of
human nature, and the only lawful foundations of government.
America, in the assembly of nations, since her admission among
them, has invariably, though often fruitlessly, held forth to them
the hand of honest friendship, of equal freedom, of generous
reciprocity. She has uniformly spoken among them, though often
to heedless and often to disdainful ears, the language of equal
liberty, equal justice, and equal rights. She has, in the lapse of
nearly half a century, without a single exception, respected the
independence of other nations, while asserting and maintaining
her own. She has abstained from interference in the concerns of
others, even when the conflict has been for principles to which
she clings, as to the last vital drop that visits the heart. She
has seen that probably for centuries to come, all the contests of
that Aceldama, the European World, will be contests between
inveterate power and emerging right. Wherever the standard of
freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there
will her heart, her benedictions, and her prayers be. But she
goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the
well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the
champion and vindicator only of her own. She will recommend
the general cause, by the countenance of her voice, and the
benignant sympathy of her example. She well knows that by
once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even
the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself,
beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and
intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume
the colors and usurp the standard of freedom. The fundamental
maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to
force. The frontlet upon her brows would no longer beam with
the ineffable splendor of freedom and independence; but in its
stead would soon be substituted an imperial diadem, flashing in
false and tarnished lustre the murky radiance of dominion and
power. She might become the dictatress of the world; she would
no longer be the ruler of her own spirit.</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="THE_RIGHT_OF_PETITION"></a>THE RIGHT OF PETITION</h3>
<center>Quoted in Memoir by Josiah Quincy.</center>

<p>Sir, it is ... well known that, from the time I entered this
house, down to the present day, I have felt it a sacred duty
to present any petition, couched in respectful language, from
any citizen of the United States, be its object what it may,--be
the prayer of it that in which I could concur, or that to which I
was utterly opposed. I adhere to the right of petition; and let
me say here that, let the petition be, as the gentleman from
Virginia has stated, from free negroes, prostitutes, as he supposes,--for
he says there is one put on this paper, and he infers that
the rest are of the same description,--<i>that</i> has not altered my
opinion at all. Where is your law that says that the mean, the
low, and the degraded, shall be deprived of the right of petition,
if their moral character is not good? Where, in the land of free-men,
was the right of petition ever placed on the exclusive basis
of morality and virtue? Petition is supplication--it is entreaty--it
is prayer! And where is the degree of vice or immorality
which shall deprive the citizen of the right to supplicate for a
boon, or to pray for mercy? Where is such a law to be found?
It does not belong to the most abject despotism. There is no
absolute monarch on earth who is not compelled, by the constitution
of his country, to receive the petitions of his people, whosoever
they may be. The Sultan of Constantinople cannot walk
the streets and refuse to receive petitions from the meanest and
vilest in the land. This is the law even of despotism; and what
does your law say? Does it say, that, before presenting a petition,
you shall look into it and see whether it comes from the
virtuous, and the great, and the mighty? No, sir; it says no such
thing. The right of petition belongs to all; and so far from
refusing to present a petition because it might come from those
low in the estimation of the world, it would be an additional
incentive, if such an incentive were wanting.</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="NULLIFICATION"></a>NULLIFICATION</h3>
<center>From his Fourth of July Oration at Quincy, 1831</center>

<p>Nullification is the provocation to that brutal and foul contest
of force, which has hitherto baffled all the efforts of the
European and Southern American nations, to introduce
among them constitutional governments of liberty and order. It
strips us of that peculiar and unimitated characteristic of all our
legislation--free debate; it makes the bayonet the arbiter of law;
it has no argument but the thunderbolt. It were senseless to
imagine that twenty-three States of the Union would suffer their
laws to be trampled upon by the despotic mandate of one. The
act of nullification would itself be null and void. Force must be
called in to execute the law of the Union. Force must be applied
by the nullifying State to resist its execution--</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ate, hot from Hell,<br>
Cries Havoc! and lets slip the dogs of war.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>The blood of brethren is shed by each other. The citizen of
the nullifying State is a traitor to his country, by obedience to
the law of his State; a traitor to his State, by obedience to the law
of his country. The scaffold and the battle-field stream alternately
with the blood of their victims. Let this agent but once
intrude upon your deliberations, and Freedom will take her flight
for heaven. The Declaration of Independence will become a philosophical
dream, and uncontrolled, despotic sovereignties will
trample with impunity, through a long career of after ages, at
interminable or exterminating war with one another, upon the
indefeasible and unalienable rights of man.</p>

<p>The event of a conflict of arms, between the Union and one
of its members, whether terminating in victory or defeat, would
be but an alternative of calamity to all. In the holy records of
antiquity, we have two examples of a confederation ruptured by
the severance of its members; one of which resulted, after three
desperate battles, in the extermination of the seceding tribe. And
the victorious people, instead of exulting in shouts of triumph,
&quot;came to the House of God, and abode there till even before
God; and lifted up their voices, and wept sore, and said,--O
Lord God of Israel, <i>why</i> is this come to pass in Israel, that there
should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?&quot; The other was a
successful example of resistance against tyrannical taxation, and
severed forever the confederacy, the fragments forming separate
kingdoms; and from that day, their history presents an unbroken
series of disastrous alliances and exterminating wars--of assassinations,
conspiracies, revolts, and rebellions, until both parts of
the confederacy sunk in tributary servitude to the nations around
them; till the countrymen of David and Solomon hung their
harps upon the willows of Babylon, and were totally lost among
the multitudes of the Chaldean and Assyrian monarchies, &quot;the
most despised portion of their slaves.&quot;</p>

<p>In these mournful memorials of their fate, we may behold
the sure, too sure prognostication of our own, from the hour
when force shall be substituted for deliberation in the settlement
of our Constitutional questions. This is the deplorable alternative--the
extirpation of the seceding member, or the never-ceasing
struggle of two rival confederacies, ultimately bending the neck of
both under the yoke of foreign domination, or the despotic sovereignty
of a conqueror at home. May Heaven avert the omen!
The destinies of not only our posterity, but of the human race,
are at stake.</p>

<p>Let no such melancholy forebodings intrude upon the festivities
of this anniversary. Serene skies and balmy breezes are not
congenial to the climate of freedom. Progressive improvement
in the condition of man is apparently the purpose of a superintending
Providence. That purpose will not be disappointed. In
no delusion of national vanity, but with a feeling of profound
gratitude to the God of our Fathers, let us indulge the cheering
hope and belief, that our country and her people have been
selected as instruments for preparing and maturing much of the
good yet in reserve for the welfare and happiness of the human
race. Much good has already been effected by the solemn proclamation
of our principles, much more by the illustration of our
example. The tempest which threatens desolation, may be destined
only to purify the atmosphere. It is not in tranquil ease
and enjoyment that the active energies of mankind are displayed.
Toils and dangers are the trials of the soul. Doomed to the
first by his sentence at the fall, man, by his submission, converts
them into pleasures. The last are since the fall the condition of
his existence. To see them in advance, to guard against them
by all the suggestions of prudence, to meet them with the composure
of unyielding resistance, and to abide with firm resignation
the final dispensation of Him who rules the ball,--these are
the dictates of philosophy--these are the precepts of religion--these
are the principles and consolations of patriotism; these remain
when all is lost--and of these is composed the spirit of
independence--the spirit embodied in that beautiful personification
of the poet, which may each of you, my countrymen, to the
last hour of his life, apply to himself:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Thy spirit, Independence, let me share,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the lion heart and eagle eye!<br>
Thy steps I follow, with my bosom bare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>In the course of nature, the voice which now addresses you
must soon cease to be heard upon earth. Life and all which it
inherits, lose of their value as it draws toward its close. But for
most of you, my friends and neighbors, long and many years of
futurity are yet in store. May they be years of freedom--years
of prosperity--years of happiness, ripening for immortality! But,
were the breath which now gives utterance to my feelings, the
last vital air I should draw, my expiring words to you and your
children should be, INDEPENDENCE AND UNION FOREVER!</p>

<h2><a name="SARAH_FLOWER_ADAMS"></a>SARAH FLOWER ADAMS</h2>
<h3>(1805--1848)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>his English poet, whose hymn, 'Nearer, my God, to Thee,' is
known wherever the English language is spoken, was born
at Great Harlow, Essex, England, in 1805. She was the
daughter of Benjamin Flower, who in 1799 was prosecuted for plain
speaking in his paper, the Cambridge Intelligencer. From the outcome
of his trial is to be dated the liberty of political discussion
in England. Her mother was Eliza Gould, who first met her future
husband in jail, whither she had gone on a visit to assure him of her
sympathy. She also had suffered for liberal opinions. From their
parents two daughters inherited a distinguished nobility and purity of
character. Eliza excelled in the composition of music for congregational
worship, and arranged a musical service for the Unitarian
South Place Chapel, London. Sarah contributed first to the Monthly
Repository, conducted by W.J. Fox, her Unitarian pastor, in whose
family she lived after her father's death. In 1834 she married William
Bridges Adams. Her delicate health gave way under the shock of
her sister's death in 1846, and she died of decline in 1848.</p>

<p>Her poetic genius found expression both in the drama and in
hymns. Her play, 'Vivia Perpetua' (1841), tells of the author's rapt
aspiration after an ideal, symbolized in a pagan's conversion to
Christianity. She published also 'The Royal Progress,' a ballad (1845), on
the giving tip of the feudal privileges of the Isle of Wight to Edward
I.; and poems upon the humanitarian interests which the Anti-Corn-Law
League endeavored to further. Her hymns are the happiest
expressions of the religious trust, resignation, and sweetness of her
nature.</p>

<p>'Nearer, my God, to Thee,' was written for the South Place
Chapel service. There are stories of its echoes having been heard
from a dilapidated log cabin in Arkansas, from a remote corner of
the north of England, and from the Heights of Benjamin in the Holy
Land. But even its devotion and humility have not escaped censure--arising,
perhaps, from denominational bias. The fault found with it
is the fault of Addison's 'How are thy servants blessed, O Lord,'
and the fault of the Psalmody begun by Sternhold and Hopkins,
which, published in Geneva in 1556, electrified the congregation of
six thousand souls in Elizabeth's reign,--it has no direct reference
to Jesus. Compilers of hymn-books have sought to rectify what they
deem a lapse in Christian spirit by the substitution of a verse begining
&quot;Christ alone beareth me.&quot; But the quality of the interpolated
verse is so inferior to the lyric itself that it has not found general
acceptance. Others, again, with an excess of zeal, have endeavored
to substitute &quot;the Cross&quot; for &quot;a cross&quot; in the first stanza.</p>

<p>An even share of its extraordinary vogue must in bare justice be
credited to the tune which Dr. Lowell Mason has made an inseparable
part of it; though this does not detract in the least from its
own high merit, or its capacity to satisfy the feelings of a devout
soul. A taking melody is the first condition of even the loveliest
song's obtaining popularity; and this hymn was sung for many years
to various tunes, including chants, with no general recognition of its
quality. It was Dr. Mason's tune, written about 1860, which sent it
at once into the hearts of the people.</p>

<h2><a name="JOSEPH_ADDISON"></a>JOSEPH ADDISON</h2>
<h3>(1672-1719)</h3>

<h3>BY HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>here are few figures in literary history more dignified and
attractive than Joseph Addison; few men more eminently
representative, not only of literature as a profession, but of
literature as an art. It has happened more than once that literary
gifts of a high order have been lodged in very frail moral tenements;
that taste, feeling, and felicity of expression have been divorced from
general intellectual power, from intimate acquaintance with the best
in thought and art, from grace of manner and dignity of life. There
have been writers of force and originality who failed to attain a
representative eminence, to identify themselves with their art in the
memory of the world. There have been other writers without claim
to the possession of gifts of the highest order, who have secured this
distinction by virtue of harmony of character and work, of breadth
of interest, and of that fine intelligence which instinctively allies
itself with the best in its time. Of this class Addison is an illustrious
example. His gifts are not of the highest order; there was none of
the spontaneity, abandon, or fertility of genius in him; his thought
made no lasting contribution to the highest intellectual life; he set no
pulses beating by his eloquence of style, and fired no imagination by
the insight and emotion of his verse; he was not a scholar in the
technical sense: and yet, in an age which was stirred and stung by
the immense satiric force of Swift, charmed by the wit and elegance
of Pope, moved by the tenderness of Steele, and enchanted by the
fresh realism of De Foe, Addison holds the most representative place.
He is, above all others, the Man of Letters of his time; his name
instantly evokes the literature of his period.</p>

</p><br>

<p>Born in the rectory at Milston, Wiltshire, on May Day, 1672, it was
Addison's fortune to take up the profession of Letters at the very
moment when it was becoming a recognized profession, with a field
of its own, and with emoluments sufficient in kind to make decency
of living possible, and so related to a man's work that their acceptance
involved loss neither of dignity nor of independence. He was
contemporary with the first English publisher, Jacob Tonson. He
was also contemporary with the notable reorganization of English
prose which freed it from exaggeration, complexity, and obscurity;
and he contributed not a little to the flexibility, charm, balance, and
ease which have since characterized its best examples. He saw the
rise of polite society in its modern sense; the development of the
social resources of the city; the enlargement of what is called &quot;the
reading class&quot; to embrace all classes in the community and all orders
in the nation. And he was one of the first, following the logic of
a free press, an organized business for the sale of books, and the
appearance of popular interest in literature, to undertake that work of
translating the best thought, feeling, sentiment, and knowledge of
his time, and of all times, into the language of the drawing-room, the
club, and the street, which has done so much to humanize and civilize
the modern world.</p>

<p>To recognize these various opportunities, to feel intuitively the
drift of sentiment and conviction, and so to adjust the uses of art to
life as to exalt the one, and enrich and refine the other, involved
not only the possession of gifts of a high order, but that training
which puts a man in command of himself and of his materials.
Addison was fortunate in that incomparably important education
which assails a child through every sense, and above all through the
imagination--in the atmosphere of a home, frugal in its service to
the body, but prodigal in its ministry to the spirit. His father was
a man of generous culture: an Oxford scholar, who had stood frankly
for the Monarchy and Episcopacy in Puritan times; a voluminous and
agreeable writer; of whom Steele says that he bred his five children
&quot;with all the care imaginable in a liberal and generous way.&quot; From
this most influential of schools Addison passed on to other masters:
from the Grammar School at Lichfield, to the well-known Charter
House; and thence to Oxford, where he first entered Queen's College,
and later, became a member of Magdalen, to the beauty of whose
architecture and natural situation the tradition of his walks and
personality adds no small charm. He was a close student, shy in manner,
given to late hours of work. His literary tastes and appetite
were early disclosed, and in his twenty-second year he was already
known in London, had written an 'Account of the Greatest English
Poets,' and had addressed some complimentary verses to Dryden,
then the recognized head of English Letters.</p>

<p>While Addison was hesitating what profession to follow, the leaders
of the political parties were casting about for men of literary
power. A new force had appeared in English politics--the force of
public opinion; and in their experiments to control and direct this
novel force, politicians were eager to secure the aid of men of Letters.
The shifting of power to the House of Commons involved a
radical readjustment, not only of the mechanism of political action,
but of the attitude of public men to the nation. They felt the need
of trained and persuasive interpreters and advocates; of the resources
of wit, satire, and humor. It was this very practical service which
literature was in the way of rendering to political parties, rather than
any deep regard for literature itself, which brought about a brief but
brilliant alliance between groups of men who have not often worked
together to mutual advantage. It must be said, however, that there
was among the great Whig and Tory leaders of the time a certain
liberality of taste, and a care for those things which give public life
dignity and elegance, which were entirely absent from Robert Walpole
and the leaders of the two succeeding reigns, when literature
and politics were completely divorced, and the government knew
little and cared less for the welfare of the arts. Addison came on
the stage at the very moment when the government was not only
ready but eager to foster such talents as his. He was a Whig of
pronounced although modern type, and the Whigs were in power.</p>

<p>Lord Somers and Charles Montagu, better known later as Lord
Halifax, were the heads of the ministry, and his personal friends as
well. They were men of culture, lovers of Letters, and not unappreciative
of the personal distinction which already stamped the
studious and dignified Magdalen scholar. A Latin poem on the Peace
of Ryswick, dedicated to Montagu, happily combined Virgilian elegance
and felicity with Whig sentiment and achievement. It confirmed
the judgment already formed of Addison's ability; and, setting
aside with friendly insistence the plan of putting that ability into the
service of the Church, Montagu secured a pension of &pound;300 for the
purpose of enabling Addison to fit himself for public employment
abroad by thorough study of the French language, and of manners,
methods, and institutions on the Continent. With eight Latin poems,
published in the second volume of the 'Musae Anglicanae,' as an
introduction to foreign scholars, and armed with letters of introduction
from Montagu to many distinguished personages, Addison left Oxford
in the summer of 1699, and, after a prolonged stay at Blois for purposes
of study, visited many cities and interesting localities in France,
Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and Holland. The shy, reticent,
but observing young traveler was everywhere received with the
courtesy which early in the century had made so deep an impression
on the young Milton. He studied hard, saw much, and meditated
more. He was not only fitting himself for public service, but for
that delicate portraiture of manners which was later to become his
distinctive work. Clarendon had already drawn a series of lifelike
portraits of men of action in the stormy period of the Revolution:
Addison was to sketch the society of his time with a touch at once
delicate and firm; to exhibit its life in those aspects which emphasize
individual humor and personal quality, against a carefully wrought
background of habit, manners, usage, and social condition. The
habit of observation and the wide acquaintance with cultivated and
elegant social life which was a necessary part of the training for the
work which was later to appear in the pages of the Spectator, were
perhaps the richest educational results of these years of travel and
study; for Addison the official is a comparatively obscure figure, but
Addison the writer is one of the most admirable and attractive figures
in English history.</p>

<p>Addison returned to England in 1703 with clouded prospects. The
accession of Queen Anne had been followed by the dismissal of the
Whigs from office; his pension was stopped, his opportunity of advancement
gone, and his father dead. The skies soon brightened,
however: the support of the Whigs became necessary to the Government;
the brilliant victory of Blenheim shed lustre not only on Marlborough,
but on the men with whom he was politically affiliated; and
there was great dearth of poetic ability in the Tory ranks at the very
moment when a notable achievement called for brave and splendid
verse. Lord Godolphin, that easy-going and eminently successful
politician of whom Charles the Second once shrewdly said that he
was &quot;never in the way and never out of it,&quot; was directed to Addison
in this emergency; and the story goes that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, afterward Lord Carleton, who was sent to express to the
needy scholar the wishes of the Government, found him lodged in a
garret over a small shop. The result of this memorable embassy
from politics to literature was 'The Campaign': an eminently successful
poem of the formal, &quot;occasional&quot; order, which celebrated the
victor of Blenheim with tact and taste, pleased the ministry, delighted
the public, and brought reputation and fortune to its unknown
writer. Its excellence is in skillful avoidance of fulsome adulation, in
the exclusion of the well-worn classical allusions, and in a straightforward
celebration of those really great qualities in Marlborough
which set his military career in brilliant contrast with his private life.
The poem closed with a simile which took the world by storm:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;So when an angel, by divine command,<br>
With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,<br>
(Such as of late o'er pale Britannia passed,)<br>
Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;<br>
And, pleased the Almighty's orders to perform,<br>
Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Addison left off at a good moment,&quot; says Thackeray. &quot;That
simile was pronounced to be the greatest ever produced in poetry.
That angel, that good angel, flew off with Mr. Addison, and landed
him in the place of Commissioner of Appeals--<i>vice</i> Mr. Locke, providentially
promoted. In the following year Mr. Addison went to
Hanover with Lord Halifax, and the year after was made Under-Secretary
of State. O angel visits! You come 'few and far between'
to literary gentlemen's lodgings! Your wings seldom quiver at the
second-floor windows now!&quot;</p>

<p>The prize poem was followed by a narrative of travel in Italy,
happily written, full of felicitous description, and touched by a humor
which, in quality and manner, was new to English readers. Then
came one of those indiscretions of the imagination which showed
that the dignified and somewhat sober young poet, the &quot;parson in a
tye-wig,&quot; as he was called at a later day, was not lacking in gayety
of mood. The opera 'Rosamond' was not a popular success, mainly
because the music to which it was set fell so far below it in grace
and ease. It must be added, however, that Addison lacked the qualities
of a successful libretto writer. He was too serious, and despite
the lightness of his touch, there was a certain rigidity in him which
made him unapt at versification which required quickness, agility,
and variety. When he attempted to give his verse gayety of manner,
he did not get beyond awkward simulation of an ease which nature
had denied him:--</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Since conjugal passion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is come into fashion,<br>
And marriage so blest on the throne is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a Venus I'll shine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be fond and be fine,<br>
And Sir Trusty shall be my Adonis.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Meantime, in spite of occasional clouds, Addison's fortunes were
steadily advancing. The Earl of Wharton was appointed Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland, and Addison accepted the lucrative post of Secretary.
Spenser had found time and place, during a similar service in
the same country, to complete the 'Faery Queene'; although the fair
land in which the loveliest of English poems has its action was not
unvexed by the chronic turbulence of a mercurial and badly used
race. Irish residence was coincident in Addison's case, not only with
prosperous fortunes and with important friendships, but also with the
beginning of the work on which his fame securely rests. In Ireland
the acquaintance he had already made in London with Swift ripened
into a generous friendship, which for a time resisted political differences
when such differences were the constant occasion of personal
animosity and bitterness. The two men represented the age in an
uncommonly complete way. Swift had the greater genius: he was,
indeed, in respect of natural endowment, the foremost man of his
time; but his nature was undisciplined, his temper uncertain, and his
great powers quite as much at the service of his passions as of his
principles. He made himself respected, feared, and finally hated;
his lack of restraint and balance, his ferocity of spirit when opposed,
and the violence with which he assailed his enemies, neutralized
his splendid gifts, marred his fortune, and sent him into lonely exile
at Dublin, where he longed for the ampler world of London. Few
figures in literary history are more pathetic than that of the old
Dean of St. Patrick's, broken in spirit, failing in health, his noble
faculties gone into premature decay, forsaken, bitter, and remorseful.
At the time of Addison's stay in Ireland, the days of Swift's eclipse
were, however, far distant; both men were in their prime. That
Swift loved Addison is clear enough; and it is easy to understand
the qualities which made Addison one of the most deeply loved men
of his time. He was of an eminently social temper, although averse
to large companies and shy and silent in their presence. &quot;There is
no such thing,&quot; he once said, &quot;as real conversation but between two
persons.&quot; He was free from malice, meanness, or jealousy, Pope to
the contrary notwithstanding. He was absolutely loyal to his principles
and to his friends, in a time when many men changed both
with as little compunction as they changed wigs and swords. His
personality was singularly winning; his features regular, and full of
refinement and intelligence; his bearing dignified and graceful; his
temper kindly and in perfect control; his character without a stain;
his conversation enchanting, its charm confessed by persons so
diverse in taste as Pope, Swift, Steele, and Young. Lady Mary
Montagu declared that he was the best company she had ever known.
He had two faults of which the world has heard much: he loved the
company of men who flattered him, and at times he used wine
too freely. The first of these defects was venial, and did not blind
his judgment either of himself or his friends; the second defect was
so common among the men of his time that Addison's occasional
over-indulgence, in contrast with the excesses of others, seems like
temperance itself.</p>

<p>The harmony and symmetry of this winning personality has, in a
sense, told against it; for men are prone to call the well-balanced
nature cold and the well-regulated life Pharisaic. Addison did not
escape charges of this kind from the wild livers of his own time,
who could not dissociate genius from profligacy nor generosity of
nature from prodigality. It was one of the great services of Addison
to his generation and to all generations, that in an age of violent
passions, he showed how a strong man could govern himself. In a
time of reckless living, he illustrated the power which flows from
subordination of pleasure to duty. In a day when wit was identified
with malice, he brought out its power to entertain, surprise, and
delight, without taking on the irreverent levity of Voltaire, the
bitterness of Swift, or the malice of Pope.</p>

<p>It was during Addison's stay in Ireland that Richard Steele projected
the Tatler, and brought out the first number in 1709. His
friendship for Addison amounted almost to a passion; their intimacy
was cemented by harmony of tastes and diversity of character.
Steele was ardent, impulsive, warm-hearted, mercurial; full of aspiration
and beset by lamentable weaknesses,--preaching the highest
morality and constantly falling into the prevalent vices of his time;
a man so lovable of temper, so generous a spirit, and so frank a
nature, that his faults seem to humanize his character rather than
to weaken and stain it. Steele's gifts were many, and they were
always at the service of his feelings; he had an Irish warmth of
sympathy and an Irish readiness of humor, with great facility of
inventiveness, and an inexhaustible interest in all aspects of human
experience. There had been political journals in England since the
time of the Revolution, but Steele conceived the idea of a journal
which should comment on the events and characteristics of the time
in a bright and humorous way; using freedom with judgment and
taste, and attacking the vices and follies of the time with the light
equipment of wit rather than with the heavy armament of the formal
moralist. The time was ripe for such an enterprise. London was
full of men and women of brilliant parts, whose manners, tastes,
and talk presented rich material for humorous report and delineation
or for satiric comment. Society, in the modern sense, was fast taking
form, and the resources of social intercourse were being rapidly
developed. Men in public life were intimately allied with society
and sensitive to its opinion; and men of all interests--public, fashionable,
literary--gathered in groups at the different chocolate or coffee
houses, and formed a kind of organized community. It was distinctly
an aristocratic society: elegant in dress, punctilious in manner, exacting
in taste, ready to be amused, and not indifferent to criticism
when it took the form of sprightly badinage or of keen and trenchant
satire. The informal organization of society, which made it possible
to reach and affect the Town as a whole, is suggested by the
division of the Tatler:--</p>

<p>&quot;All accounts of Gallantry, Pleasure, and Entertainment, shall be
under the article of White's Chocolate-House; Poetry under that of
Will's Coffee-House; Learning under the title of Grecian; Foreign and
Domestic News you will have from St. James's Coffee-House; and
what else I have to offer on any other subject shall be dated from
my own apartment.&quot;</p>

<p>So wrote Steele in his introduction to the readers of the new journal,
which was to appear three times a week, at the cost of a penny.
Of the coffee-houses enumerated, St. James's and White's were the
headquarters of men of fashion and of politics; the Grecian of men of
legal learning; Will's of men of Letters. The Tatler was successful
from the start. It was novel in form and in spirit; it was sprightly
without being frivolous, witty without being indecent, keen without
being libelous or malicious. In the general license and coarseness of
the time, so close to the Restoration and the powerful reaction against
Puritanism, the cleanness, courtesy, and good taste which characterized
the journal had all the charm of a new diversion. In paper No. 18,
Addison made his appearance as a contributor, and gave the world
the first of those inimitable essays which influenced their own time so
widely, and which have become the solace and delight of all times.
To Addison's influence may perhaps be traced the change which
came over the Tatler, and which is seen in the gradual disappearance
of the news element, and the steady drift of the paper away from
journalism and toward literature. Society soon felt the full force of
the extraordinary talent at the command of the new censor of contemporary
manners and morals. There was a well-directed and incessant
fire of wit against the prevailing taste of dramatic art; against
the vices of gambling and dueling; against extravagance and affectation
of dress and manner: and there was also criticism of a new
order.</p>

<p>The Tatler was discontinued in January, 1711, and the first number
of the Spectator appeared in March. The new journal was issued
daily, but it made no pretensions to newspaper timeliness or interest;
it aimed to set a new standard in manners, morals, and taste, without
assuming the airs of a teacher. &quot;It was said of Socrates,&quot; wrote
Addison, in a memorable chapter in the new journal, &quot;that he
brought Philosophy down from heaven to inhabit among men; and I
shall be happy to have it said of me that I have brought Philosophy
out of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs
and assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses.&quot; For more than
two years the Spectator discharged with inimitable skill and success
the difficult function of chiding, reproving, and correcting, without
irritating, wounding, or causing strife. Swift found the paper too
gentle, but its influence was due in no small measure to its persuasiveness.
Addison studied his method of attack as carefully as Matthew
Arnold, who undertook a similar educational work in our own
time, studied his means of approach to a public indifferent or hostile
to his ideas. The two hundred and seventy-four papers furnished by
Addison to the columns of the Spectator may be said to mark the
full development of English prose as a free, flexible, clear, and elegant
medium of expressing the most varied and delicate shades of
thought. They mark also the perfection of the essay form in our
literature; revealing clear perception of its limitations and of its
resources; easy mastery of its possibilities of serious exposition and
of pervading charm; ability to employ its full capacity of conveying
serious thought in a manner at once easy and authoritative. They
mark also the beginning of a deeper and more intelligent criticism;
for their exposition of Milton may be said to point the way to a new
quality of literary judgment and a new order of literary comment.
These papers mark, finally, the beginnings of the English novel; for
they contain a series of character-studies full of insight, delicacy of
drawing, true feeling, and sureness of touch. Addison was not content
to satirize the follies, attack the vices, and picture the manners
of his times: he created a group of figures which stand out as distinctly
as those which were drawn more than a century later by
the hand of Thackeray, our greatest painter of manners. De Foe had
not yet published the first of the great modern novels of incident
and adventure in 'Robinson Crusoe,' and Richardson, Fielding, and
Smollett were unborn or unknown, when Addison was sketching Sir
Roger de Coverley and Will Honeycomb, and filling in the background
with charming studies of life in London and in the country.
The world has instinctively selected Sir Roger de Coverley as the
truest of all the creations of Addison's imagination; and it sheds clear
light on the fineness of Addison's nature that among the four characters
in fiction whom English readers have agreed to accept as typical
gentlemen,--Don Quixote, Sir Roger de Coverley, Henry Esmond, and
Colonel Newcombe,--the old English baronet holds a secure place.</p>

<p>Finished in style, but genuinely human in feeling, betraying the
nicest choice of words and the most studied care for elegant and
effective arrangement, and yet penetrated by geniality, enlivened by
humor, elevated by high moral aims, often using the dangerous
weapons of irony and satire, and yet always well-mannered and
kindly,--these papers reveal the sensitive nature of Addison and the
delicate but thoroughly tempered art which he had at his command.</p>

<p>Rarely has literature of so high an order had such instant success;
for the popularity of the Spectator has been rivaled in English
literature only by that of the Waverley novels or of the novels of
Dickens. Its influence was felt not only in the sentiment of the
day, and in the crowd of imitators which followed in its wake, but
also across the Channel. In Germany, especially, the genius and
methods of Addison made a deep and lasting impression.</p>

<p>No man could reach such eminence in the first quarter of the
last century without being tempted to try his hand at play-writing;
and the friendly fortune which seemed to serve Addison at every
turn reached its climax in the applause which greeted the production
of 'Cato.' The motive of this tragedy, constructed on what were
then held to be classic lines, is found in the two lines of the
Prologue: it was an endeavor to portray</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;A brave man struggling in the storms of fate,<br>
And greatly falling with a falling State.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>The play was full of striking lines which were instantly caught
up and applied to the existing political situation; the theatre was
crowded night after night, and the resources of Europe in the way
of translations, plaudits, and favorable criticisms were exhausted in
the endeavor to express the general approval. The judgment of a
later period has, however, assigned 'Cato' a secondary place, and it
is remembered mainly on account of its many felicitous passages.
It lacks real dramatic unity and vitality; the character of Cato is
essentially an abstraction; there is little dramatic necessity in the
situations and incidents. It is rhetorical rather than poetic, declamatory
rather than dramatic. Johnson aptly described it as &quot;rather a
poem in dialogue than a drama, rather a succession of just sentiments
in elegant language than a representation of natural affections,
or of any state probable or possible in human life.&quot;</p>

<p>Addison's popularity touched its highest point in the production
of 'Cato.' Even his conciliatory nature could not disarm the envy
which such brilliant success naturally aroused, nor wholly escape the
bitterness which the intense political feeling of the time constantly
bred between ambitious and able men. Political differences separated
him from Swift, and Steele's uncertain character and inconsistent
course blighted what was probably the most delightful intimacy of
his life. Pope doubtless believed that he had good ground for charging
Addison with jealousy and insincerity, and in 1715 an open
rupture took place between them. The story of the famous quarrel
was first told by Pope, and his version was long accepted in many
quarters as final; but later opinion inclines to hold Addison guiltless
of the grave accusations brought against him. Pope was morbidly
sensitive to slights, morbidly eager for praise, and extremely irritable.
To a man of such temper, trifles light as air became significant of
malice and hatred. Such trifles unhappily confirmed Pope's suspicions;
his self-love was wounded, sensitiveness became animosity,
and animosity became hate, which in the end inspired the most
stinging bit of satire in the language:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Should such a one, resolved to reign alone,<br>
Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne,<br>
View him with jealous yet with scornful eyes,<br>
Hate him for arts that caused himself to rise,<br>
Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,<br>
And, without sneering, teach the rest to sneer;<br>
Alike unused to blame or to commend,<br>
A timorous foe and a suspicious friend,<br>
Fearing e'en fools, by flatterers besieged,<br>
And so obliging that he ne'er obliged;<br>
Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>There was just enough semblance of truth in these inimitable
lines to give them lasting stinging power; but that they were grossly
unjust is now generally conceded. Addison was human, and therefore
not free from the frailties of men of his profession; but there
was no meanness in him.</p>

<p>Addison's loyalty to the Whig party and his ability to serve it
kept him in intimate relations with its leaders and bound him to its
fortunes. He served the Whig cause in Parliament, and filled many
positions which required tact and judgment, attaining at last the
very dignified post of Secretary of State. A long attachment for
the Countess of Warwick culminated in marriage in 1716, and
Addison took up his residence in Holland House; a house famous
for its association with men of distinction in politics and letters.
The marriage was not happy, if report is to be trusted. The union
of the ill-adapted pair was, in any event, short-lived; for three years
later, in 1719, Addison died in his early prime, not yet having completed
his forty-eighth year. On his death-bed, Young tells us, he
called his stepson to his side and said, &quot;See in what peace a Christian
can die.&quot; His body was laid in Westminster Abbey; his work
is one of the permanent possessions of the English-speaking race;
his character is one of its finest traditions. He was, as truly as Sir
Philip Sidney, a gentleman in the sweetness of his spirit, the courage
of his convictions, the refinement of his bearing, and the purity
of his life. He was unspoiled by fortune and applause; uncorrupted
by the tempting chances of his time; stainless in the use of gifts
which in the hands of a man less true would have caught the contagion
of Pope's malice or of Swift's corroding cynicism.</p>

<h3><a name="SIR_ROGER_DE_COVERLEY_AT_THE_PLAY"></a>SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY AT THE PLAY</h3>

<center>From the Spectator, No. 335</center>

<p>My friend Sir Roger de Coverley, when we last met together
at the Club, told me, that he had a great mind to see the
new Tragedy with me, assuring me at the same time that
he had not been at a Play these twenty Years. The last I
saw, said Sir Roger, was the <i>Committee</i>, which I should not have
gone to neither, had not I been told beforehand that it was a
good Church-of-<i>England</i> Comedy. He then proceeded to enquire
of me who this Distrest Mother was; and upon hearing that she
was <i>Hector's</i> Widow, he told me that her Husband was a brave
Man, and that when he was a Schoolboy he had read his Life at
the end of the Dictionary. My friend asked me in the next
place, if there would not be some danger in coming home late,
in case the <i>Mohocks</i><a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a> should be Abroad. I assure you, says he,
I thought I had fallen into their Hands last Night; for I observed
two or three lusty black Men that follow'd me half way up <i>Fleet-street,</i>
and mended their pace behind me, in proportion as I put
on to get away from them. You must know, continu'd the
Knight with a Smile, I fancied they had a mind to <i>hunt</i> me; for
I remember an honest Gentleman in my Neighbourhood, who was
served such a trick in King <i>Charles</i> the Second's time; for which
reason he has not ventured himself in Town ever since. I might
have shown them very good Sport, had this been their Design;
for as I am an old Fox-hunter, I should have turned and dodg'd,
and have play'd them a thousand tricks they had never seen in
their Lives before. Sir Roger added, that if these gentlemen had
any such Intention, they did not succeed very well in it: for I
threw them out, says he, at the End of <i>Norfolk street</i>, where I
doubled the Corner, and got shelter in my Lodgings before they
could imagine what was become of me. However, says the
Knight, if Captain Sentry will make one with us to-morrow
night, and if you will both of you call upon me about four
a Clock, that we may be at the House before it is full, I will
have my own Coach in readiness to attend you, for <i>John</i> tells me
he has got the Fore-Wheels mended.</p>

<blockquote>
<a name="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1">[1]</a> London &quot;bucks&quot; who disguised themselves as savages and roamed the
streets at night, committing outrages on persons and property.
</blockquote>

<p>The Captain, who did not fail to meet me there at the
appointed Hour, bid Sir Roger fear nothing, for that he had put
on the same Sword which he made use of at the Battel of <i>Steenkirk.</i>
Sir Roger's Servants, and among the rest my old Friend
the Butler, had, I found, provided themselves with good Oaken
Plants, to attend their Master upon this occasion. When he had
placed him in his Coach, with my self at his Left-Hand, the
Captain before him, and his Butler at the Head of his Footmen
in the Rear, we convoy'd him in safety to the Play-house, where,
after having marched up the Entry in good order, the Captain
and I went in with him, and seated him betwixt us in the Pit.
As soon as the House was full, and the Candles lighted, my old
Friend stood up and looked about him with that Pleasure, which
a Mind seasoned with Humanity naturally feels in its self, at the
sight of a Multitude of People who seem pleased with one another,
and partake of the same common Entertainment. I could
not but fancy to myself, as the old Man stood up in the middle
of the Pit, that he made a very proper Center to a Tragick Audience.
Upon the entring of <i>Pyrrhus</i>, the Knight told me that
he did not believe the King of <i>France</i> himself had a better Strut.
I was indeed very attentive to my old Friend's Remarks, because
I looked upon them as a Piece of natural Criticism, and was well
pleased to hear him at the Conclusion of almost every Scene,
telling me that he could not imagine how the Play would end.
One while he appeared much concerned for <i>Andromache</i>; and a
little while after as much for <i>Hermione</i>: and was extremely puzzled
to think what would become of <i>Pyrrhus</i>.</p>

<p>When Sir Roger saw <i>Andromache's</i> obstinate Refusal to her
Lover's importunities, he whisper'd me in the Ear, that he was
sure she would never have him; to which he added, with a more
than ordinary Vehemence, You can't imagine, Sir, what 'tis to
have to do with a Widow. Upon <i>Pyrrhus</i> his threatning afterwards
to leave her, the Knight shook his Head, and muttered to
himself, Ay, do if you can. This Part dwelt so much upon my
Friend's Imagination, that at the close of the Third Act, as I was
thinking of something else, he whispered in my Ear, These
Widows, Sir, are the most perverse Creatures in the World.
But pray, says he, you that are a Critick, is this Play according
to your Dramatick Rules, as you call them? Should your
People in Tragedy always talk to be understood? Why, there
is not a single Sentence in this Play that I do not know the
Meaning of.</p>

<p>The Fourth Act very luckily begun before I had time to give
the old Gentleman an Answer: Well, says the Knight, sitting
down with great Satisfaction, I suppose we are now to see
<i>Hector's</i> Ghost. He then renewed his Attention, and, from time
to time, fell a praising the Widow. He made, indeed, a little
Mistake as to one of her Pages, whom at his first entering, he
took for <i>Astyanax</i>; but he quickly set himself right in that Particular,
though, at the same time, he owned he should have been
very glad to have seen the little Boy, who, says he, must needs
be a very fine Child by the Account that is given of him. Upon
<i>Hermione's</i> going off with a Menace to <i>Pyrrhus</i>, the Audience
gave a loud Clap; to which Sir Roger added, On my Word, a
notable young Baggage!</p>

<p>As there was a very remarkable Silence and Stillness in the
Audience during the whole Action, it was natural for them to
take the Opportunity of these Intervals between the Acts, to
express their Opinion of the Players, and of their respective
Parts. Sir Roger hearing a Cluster of them praise <i>Orestes</i>, struck
in with them, and told them, that he thought his Friend <i>Pylades</i>
was a very sensible Man; as they were afterwards applauding
<i>Pyrrhus</i>, Sir Roger put in a second time; And let me tell you,
says he, though he speaks but little, I like the old Fellow in
Whiskers as well as any of them. Captain Sentry seeing two or
three Waggs who sat near us, lean with an attentive Ear towards
Sir Roger, and fearing lest they should Smoke the Knight,
pluck'd him by the Elbow, and whisper'd something in his Ear,
that lasted till the Opening of the Fifth Act. The Knight was
wonderfully attentive to the Account which <i>Orestes</i> gives of <i>Pyrrhus</i>
his Death, and at the Conclusion of it, told me it was such
a bloody Piece of Work, that he was glad it was not done upon
the Stage. Seeing afterwards <i>Orestes</i> in his raving Fit, he grew
more than ordinary serious, and took occasion to moralize (in his
way) upon an Evil Conscience, adding, that <i>Orestes, in his Madness,
looked as if he saw something</i>.</p>

<p>As we were the first that came into the House, so we were
the last that went out of it; being resolved to have a clear Passage
for our old Friend, whom we did not care to venture among
the justling of the Crowd. Sir Roger went out fully satisfied
with his Entertainment, and we guarded him to his Lodgings in
the same manner that we brought him to the Playhouse; being
highly pleased, for my own part, not only with the Performance
of the excellent Piece which had been Presented, but with the
Satisfaction which it had given to the good old Man. L.</p>

<h3><a name="A_VISIT_TO_SIR_ROGER_DE_COVERLEY"></a>A VISIT TO SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY</h3>

<center>From the Spectator, No. 106</center>

<p>Having often received an Invitation from my Friend Sir Roger
de Coverley to pass away a Month with him in the Country,
I last Week accompanied him thither, and am settled with
him for some time at his Country-house, where I intend to form
several of my ensuing Speculations. Sir Roger, who is very well
acquainted with my Humour, lets me rise and go to Bed when I
please, dine at his own Table or in my Chamber as I think fit,
sit still and say nothing without bidding me be merry. When
the Gentlemen of the Country come to see him, he only shews
me at a distance: As I have been walking in his Fields I have
observed them stealing a Sight of me over an Hedge, and have
heard the Knight desiring them not to let me see them, for that
I hated to be stared at.</p>

<p>I am the more at Ease in Sir Roger's Family, because it consists
of sober and staid Persons: for as the Knight is the best
Master in the World, he seldom changes his Servants; and as he
is beloved by all about him, his Servants never care for leaving
him: by this means his Domesticks are all in years, and grown
old with their Master. You would take his Valet de Chambre
for his Brother, his Butler is grey-headed, his Groom is one of
the Gravest men that I have ever seen, and his Coachman has
the Looks of a Privy-Counsellor. You see the Goodness of the
Master even in the old House-dog, and in a grey Pad that is
kept in the Stable with great Care and Tenderness out of Regard
to his past Services, tho' he has been useless for several Years.</p>

<p>I could not but observe with a great deal of pleasure the Joy
that appeared in the Countenances of these ancient Domesticks
upon my Friend's Arrival at his Country-Seat. Some of them
could not refrain from Tears at the Sight of their old Master;
every one of them press'd forward to do something for him, and
seemed discouraged if they were not employed. At the same
time the good old Knight, with a Mixture of the Father and the
Master of the Family, tempered the Enquiries after his own
Affairs with several kind Questions relating to themselves. This
Humanity and good Nature engages every Body to him, so that
when he is pleasant upon any of them, all his Family are in
good Humour, and none so much as the Person whom he diverts
himself with: On the contrary, if he coughs, or betrays any
Infirmity of old Age, it is easy for a Stander-by to observe a
secret Concern in the Looks of all his Servants.</p>

<p>My worthy Friend has put me under the particular Care of
his Butler, who is a very prudent Man, and, as well as the rest
of his Fellow-Servants, wonderfully desirous of pleasing me,
because they have often heard their Master talk of me as of his
particular Friend.</p>

<p>My chief Companion, when Sir Roger is diverting himself in
the Woods or the Fields, is a very venerable man who is ever
with Sir Roger, and has lived at his House in the Nature of a
Chaplain above thirty Years. This Gentleman is a Person of
good Sense and some Learning, of a very regular Life and
obliging Conversation: He heartily loves Sir Roger, and knows
that he is very much in the old Knight's Esteem, so that he lives
in the Family rather as a Relation than a Dependent.</p>

<p>I have observed in several of my Papers, that my Friend Sir
Roger, amidst all his good Qualities, is something of an Humourist;
and that his Virtues, as well as Imperfections, are as it were
tinged by a certain Extravagance, which makes them particularly
<i>his</i>, and distinguishes them from those of other Men. This Cast
of Mind, as it is generally very innocent in it self, so it renders
his Conversation highly agreeable, and more delightful than the
same Degree of Sense and Virtue would appear in their common
and ordinary Colours. As I was walking with him last Night,
he asked me how I liked the good Man whom I have just now
mentioned? and without staying for my Answer told me, That he
was afraid of being insulted with Latin and Greek at his own
Table; for which Reason he desired a particular Friend of his at
the University to find him out a Clergyman rather of plain Sense
than much Learning, of a good Aspect, a clear Voice, a sociable
Temper, and, if possible, a Man that understood a little of Back-Gammon.
My Friend, says Sir Roger, found me out this Gentleman,
who, besides the Endowments required of him, is, they tell
me, a good Scholar, tho' he does not show it. I have given him
the Parsonage of the Parish; and because I know his Value have
settled upon him a good Annuity for Life. If he outlives me, he
shall find that he was higher in my Esteem than perhaps he
thinks he is. He has now been with me thirty Years; and tho'
he does not know I have taken Notice of it, has never in all that
time asked anything of me for himself, tho' he is every Day
soliciting me for something in behalf of one or other of my
Tenants his Parishioners. There has not been a Law-suit in the
Parish since he has liv'd among them: If any Dispute arises they
apply themselves to him for the Decision, if they do not acquiesce
in his Judgment, which I think never happened above once or
twice at most, they appeal to me. At his first settling with me,
I made him a Present of all the good Sermons which have been
printed in <i>English</i>, and only begg'd of him that every <i>Sunday</i> he
would pronounce one of them in the Pulpit. Accordingly, he has
digested them into such a Series, that they follow one another
naturally, and make a continued System of practical Divinity.</p>

<p>As Sir Roger was going on in his Story, the Gentleman we
were talking of came up to us; and upon the Knight's asking
him who preached to morrow (for it was <i>Saturday</i> Night) told
us, the Bishop of St. <i>Asaph</i> in the Morning, and Dr. <i>South</i> in
the Afternoon. He then shewed us his List of Preachers for the
whole Year, where I saw with a great deal of Pleasure Archbishop
<i>Tillotson</i>, Bishop <i>Saunderson</i>, Doctor <i>Barrow</i>, Doctor
<i>Calamy</i>, with several living Authors who have published Discourses
of Practical Divinity. I no sooner saw this venerable
Man in the Pulpit, but I very much approved of my Friend's
insisting upon the Qualifications of a good Aspect and a clear
Voice; for I was so charmed with the Gracefulness of his Figure
and Delivery, as well as with the Discourses he pronounced, that
I think I never passed any Time more to my Satisfaction. A
Sermon repeated after this Manner, is like the Composition of a
Poet in the Mouth of a graceful Actor.</p>

<p>I could heartily wish that more of our Country Clergy would
follow this Example; and in stead of wasting their Spirits in laborious
Compositions of their own, would endeavour after a handsome
Elocution, and all those other Talents that are proper to
enforce what has been penned by greater Masters. This would
not only be more easy to themselves, but more edifying to the
People.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_VANITY_OF_HUMAN_LIFE"></a>THE VANITY OF HUMAN LIFE</h3>

<center>'The Vision of Mirzah,' from the Spectator, No. 159</center>

<p>When I was at <i>Grand Cairo</i>, I picked up several Oriental
Manuscripts, which I have still by me. Among others I
met with one entitled, <i>The Visions of Mirzah</i>, which I
have read over with great Pleasure. I intend to give it to the
Publick when I have no other entertainment for them; and shall
begin with the first Vision, which I have translated Word for
Word as follows.</p>

<p>On the fifth Day of the Moon, which according to the Custom
of my Forefathers I always keep holy, after having washed
my self, and offered up my Morning Devotions, I ascended the
high hills of <i>Bagdat</i>, in order to pass the rest of the Day in
Meditation and Prayer. As I was here airing my self on the
Tops of the Mountains, I fell into a profound Contemplation on
the Vanity of human Life; and passing from one Thought to
another, Surely, said I, Man is but a Shadow and Life a Dream.
Whilst I was thus musing, I cast my eyes towards the Summit of
a Rock that was not far from me, where I discovered one in the
Habit of a Shepherd, with a little Musical Instrument in his
Hand. As I looked upon him he applied it to his Lips, and began
to play upon it. The sound of it was exceeding sweet, and
wrought into a Variety of Tunes that were inexpressibly melodious,
and altogether different from any thing I had ever heard.
They put me in mind of those heavenly Airs that are played to
the departed Souls of good Men upon their first Arrival in Paradise,
to wear out the Impressions of the last Agonies, and
qualify them for the Pleasures of that happy Place. My Heart
melted away in secret Raptures.</p>

<p>I had been often told that the Rock before me was the
Haunt of a Genius; and that several had been entertained with
Musick who had passed by it, but never heard that the Musician
had before made himself visible. When he had raised my
Thoughts by those transporting Airs which he played, to taste
the Pleasures of his Conversation, as I looked upon him like one
astonished, he beckoned to me, and by the waving of his Hand
directed me to approach the Place where he sat. I drew near
with that Reverence which is due to a superior Nature; and as
my heart was entirely subdued by the captivating Strains I
heard, I fell down at his Feet and wept. The Genius smiled
upon me with a Look of Compassion and Affability that familiarized
him to my Imagination, and at once dispelled all the
Fears and Apprehensions with which I approached him. He
lifted me from the Ground, and taking me by the hand, <i>Mirzah,</i>
said he, I have heard thee in thy Soliloquies; follow me.</p>

<p>He then led me to the highest Pinnacle of the Rock, and
placing me on the Top of it, Cast thy Eyes Eastward, said he,
and tell me what thou seest. I see, said I, a huge Valley, and a
prodigious Tide of Water rolling through it. The Valley that
thou seest, said he, is the Vale of Misery, and the Tide of
Water that thou seest is part of the great Tide of Eternity.
What is the Reason, said I, that the Tide I see rises out of a
thick Mist at one End, and again loses itself in a thick Mist at
the other? What thou seest, said he, is that Portion of Eternity
which is called Time, measured out by the Sun, and reaching
from the Beginning of the World to its Consummation. Examine
now, said he, this Sea that is bounded with darkness at both
Ends, and tell me what thou discoverest in it. I see a Bridge,
said I, standing in the Midst of the Tide. The Bridge thou
seest, said he, is human Life, consider it attentively. Upon a
more leisurely Survey of it, I found that it consisted of threescore
and ten entire Arches, with several broken Arches, which
added to those that were entire, made up the Number about an
hundred. As I was counting the Arches, the Genius told me
that this Bridge consisted at first of a thousand Arches; but that
a great Flood swept away the rest, and left the Bridge in the
ruinous Condition I now beheld it: But tell me further, said he,
what thou discoverest on it. I see Multitudes of People passing
over it, said I, and a black Cloud hanging on each End of it.
As I looked more attentively, I saw several of the Passengers
dropping thro' the Bridge, into the great Tide that flowed underneath
it; and upon farther Examination, perceived there were
innumerable Trap-doors that lay concealed in the Bridge, which
the Passengers no sooner trod upon, but they fell thro' them into
the Tide and immediately disappeared. These hidden Pit-falls
were set very thick at the Entrance of the Bridge, so that the
Throngs of People no sooner broke through the Cloud, but many
of them fell into them. They grew thinner towards the Middle,
but multiplied and lay closer together toward the End of the
Arches that were entire. There were indeed some Persons, but
their number was very small, that continued a kind of a hobbling
March on the broken Arches, but fell through one after another,
being quite tired and spent with so long a Walk.</p>

<p>I passed some Time in the Contemplation of this wonderful
Structure, and the great Variety of Objects which it presented.
My heart was filled with a deep Melancholy to see several dropping
unexpectedly in the midst of Mirth and Jollity, and catching
at every thing that stood by them to save themselves. Some
were looking up towards the Heavens in a thoughtful Posture,
and in the midst of a Speculation stumbled and fell out of Sight.
Multitudes were very busy in the Pursuit of Bubbles that glittered
in their Eyes and danced before them; but often when they
thought themselves within the reach of them their Footing failed
and down they sunk. In this Confusion of Objects, I observed
some with Scymetars in their Hands, and others with Urinals,
who ran to and fro upon the Bridge, thrusting several Persons
on Trap-doors which did not seem to lie in their way, and which
they might have escaped had they not been forced upon them.</p>

<p>The Genius seeing me indulge my self in this melancholy Prospect,
told me I had dwelt long enough upon it: Take thine Eyes
off the Bridge, said he, and tell me if thou yet seest any thing
thou dost not comprehend. Upon looking up, What mean, said I,
those great Flights of Birds that are perpetually hovering about
the Bridge, and settling upon it from time to time? I see Vultures,
Harpyes, Ravens, Cormorants, and among many other
feather'd Creatures several little winged Boys, that perch in great
Numbers upon the middle Arches. These, said the Genius, are
Envy, Avarice, Superstition, Despair, Love, with the like Cares
and Passions that infest human Life.</p>

<p>I here fetched a deep Sigh, Alas, said I, Man was made in
vain! How is he given away to Misery and Mortality! tortured
in Life, and swallowed up in Death! The Genius being moved
with Compassion towards me, bid me quit so uncomfortable a
Prospect: Look no more, said he, on Man in the first Stage of his
Existence, in his setting out for Eternity; but cast thine Eye on
that thick Mist into which the Tide bears the several Generations
of Mortals that fall into it. I directed my Sight as I was ordered,
and (whether or no the good Genius strengthened it with any
supernatural Force, or dissipated Part of the Mist that was before
too thick for the Eye to penetrate) I saw the Valley opening at
the farther End, and spreading forth into an immense Ocean,
that had a huge Rock of Adamant running through the Midst
of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The Clouds still
rested on one Half of it, insomuch that I could discover nothing
in it: But the other appeared to me a vast Ocean planted with
innumerable Islands, that were covered with Fruits and Flowers,
and interwoven with a thousand little shining Seas that ran
among them. I could see Persons dressed in glorious Habits
with Garlands upon their Heads, passing among the Trees, lying
down by the Side of Fountains, or resting on Beds of Flowers;
and could hear a confused Harmony of singing Birds, falling
Waters, human Voices, and musical Instruments. Gladness grew
in me upon the Discovery of so delightful a Scene. I wished for
the Wings of an Eagle, that I might fly away to those happy
Seats; but the Genius told me there was no Passage to them,
except through the Gates of Death that I saw opening every
Moment upon the Bridge. The Islands, said he, that lie so fresh
and green before thee, and with which the whole Face of the
Ocean appears spotted as far as thou canst see, are more in
number than the Sands on the Sea-shore; there are Myriads of
Islands behind those which thou here discoverest, reaching further
than thine Eye, or even thine Imagination can extend it self.
These are the Mansions of good Men after Death, who according
to the Degree and Kinds of Virtue in which they excelled, are
distributed among these several Islands, which abound with
Pleasures of different Kinds and Degrees, suitable to the Relishes
and Perfections of those who are settled in them; every Island is
a Paradise accommodated to its respective Inhabitants. Are not
these, O <i>Mirzah</i>, Habitations worth contending for? Does Life
appear miserable, that gives thee Opportunities of earning such a
Reward? Is Death to be feared, that will convey thee to so
happy an Existence? Think not Man was made in vain, who
has such an Eternity reserved for him. I gazed with inexpressible
Pleasure on these happy Islands. At length, said I, shew me
now, I beseech thee, the Secrets that lie hid under those dark
Clouds which cover the Ocean on the other side of the Rock of
Adamant. The Genius making me no Answer, I turned about to
address myself to him a second time, but I found that he had
left me; I then turned again to the Vision which I had been so
long contemplating; but Instead of the rolling Tide, the arched
Bridge, and the happy Islands, I saw nothing but the long hollow
Valley of <i>Bagdat</i>, with Oxen, Sheep, and Camels grazing upon
the Sides of it.</p><br>


<h3><a name="AN_ESSAY_ON_FANS"></a>AN ESSAY ON FANS</h3>

<center>From the Spectator, No. 102</center>
<br>

<p>I do not know whether to call the following Letter a Satyr upon
Coquets, or a Representation of their several fantastical Accomplishments,
or what other Title to give it; but as it is I shall
communicate it to the Publick. It will sufficiently explain its own
Intentions, so that I shall give it my Reader at Length, without
either Preface or Postscript.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Mr. Spectator</i>:</p>
<br>

<p>Women are armed with Fans as Men with Swords, and sometimes
do more Execution with them. To the end therefore that
Ladies may be entire Mistresses of the Weapon which they bear,
I have erected an Academy for the training up of young Women
in the <i>Exercise of the Fan</i>, according to the most fashionable Airs
and Motions that are now practis'd at Court. The Ladies who
<i>carry</i> Fans under me are drawn up twice a-day in my great
Hall, where they are instructed in the Use of their Arms, and
<i>exercised</i> by the following Words of Command,</p>


<blockquote>
Handle your Fans,<br>
Unfurl your Fans,<br>
Discharge your Fans,<br>
Ground your Fans,<br>
Recover your Fans,<br>
Flutter your Fans.<br>
</blockquote><br>

<p>By the right Observation of these few plain Words of Command,
a Woman of a tolerable Genius, who will apply herself diligently
to her Exercise for the Space of but one half Year, shall be able
to give her Fan all the Graces that can possibly enter into that
little modish Machine.</p>

<p>But to the end that my Readers may form to themselves a
right Notion of this <i>Exercise</i>, I beg leave to explain it to them
in all its Parts. When my Female Regiment is drawn up in
Array, with every one her Weapon in her Hand, upon my giving
the Word to <i>handle their Fans</i>, each of them shakes her Fan at
me with a Smile, then gives her Right-hand Woman a Tap upon
the Shoulder, then presses her Lips with the Extremity of her
Fan, then lets her Arms fall in an easy Motion, and stands in a
Readiness to receive the next Word of Command. All this is
done with a close Fan, and is generally learned in the first Week.</p>

<p>The next Motion is that of <i>unfurling the Fan</i>, in which are
comprehended several little Flirts and Vibrations, as also gradual
and deliberate Openings, with many voluntary Fallings asunder in
the Fan itself, that are seldom learned under a Month's Practice.
This part of the <i>Exercise</i> pleases the Spectators more than any
other, as it discovers on a sudden an infinite Number of <i>Cupids,</i>
[Garlands,] Altars, Birds, Beasts, Rainbows, and the like agreeable
Figures, that display themselves to View, whilst every one in
the Regiment holds a Picture in her Hand.</p>

<p>Upon my giving the Word to <i>discharge their Fans</i>, they give
one general Crack that may be heard at a considerable distance
when the Wind sits fair. This is one of the most difficult parts
of the <i>Exercise</i>; but I have several ladies with me who at their
first Entrance could not give a Pop loud enough to be heard at
the further end of a Room, who can now <i>discharge a Fan</i> in such
a manner that it shall make a Report like a Pocket-Pistol. I have
likewise taken care (in order to hinder young Women from letting
off their Fans in wrong Places or unsuitable Occasions) to shew
upon what Subject the Crack of a Fan may come in properly: I
have likewise invented a Fan, with which a Girl of Sixteen, by
the help of a little Wind which is inclosed about one of the largest
Sticks, can make as loud a Crack as a Woman of Fifty with an
ordinary Fan.</p>

<p>When the Fans are thus <i>discharged</i>, the Word of Command in
course is to <i>ground their Fans</i>. This teaches a Lady to quit her
Fan gracefully, when she throws it aside in order to take up a
Pack of Cards, adjust a Curl of Hair, replace a falling Pin, or
apply her self to any other Matter of Importance. This Part of
the <i>Exercise</i>, as it only consists in tossing a Fan with an Air
upon a long Table (which stands by for that Purpose) may be
learned in two Days Time as well as in a Twelvemonth.</p>

<p>When my Female Regiment is thus disarmed, I generally let
them walk about the Room for some Time; when on a sudden
(like Ladies that look upon their Watches after a long Visit) they
all of them hasten to their Arms, catch them up in a Hurry, and
place themselves in their proper Stations upon my calling out
<i>Recover your Fans</i>. This Part of the <i>Exercise</i> is not difficult,
provided a Woman applies her Thoughts to it.</p>

<p>The <i>Fluttering of the Fan</i> is the last, and indeed the Masterpiece
of the whole <i>Exercise</i>; but if a Lady does not mis-spend her
Time, she may make herself Mistress of it in three Months. I
generally lay aside the Dog-days and the hot Time of the Summer
for the teaching this Part of the <i>Exercise</i>; for as soon as
ever I pronounce <i>Flutter your Fans</i>, the Place is fill'd with so
many Zephyrs and gentle Breezes as are very refreshing in that
Season of the Year, tho' they might be dangerous to Ladies of a
tender Constitution in any other.</p>

<p>There is an infinite variety of Motions to be made use of in
the <i>Flutter of a Fan</i>. There is an Angry Flutter, the modest
Flutter, the timorous Flutter, the confused Flutter, the merry
Flutter, and the amorous Flutter. Not to be tedious, there is
scarce any Emotion in the Mind which does not produce a suitable
Agitation in the Fan; insomuch, that if I only see the Fan
of a disciplin'd Lady, I know very well whether she laughs,
frowns, or blushes. I have seen a Fan so very Angry, that it
would have been dangerous for the absent Lover who provoked
it to have come within the Wind of it; and at other times so
very languishing, that I have been glad for the Lady's sake the
Lover was at a sufficient Distance from it. I need not add, that a
Fan is either a Prude or Coquet according to the Nature of the
Person who bears it. To conclude my Letter, I must acquaint
you that I have from my own Observations compiled a little Treatise
for the use of my Scholars, entitled <i>The Passions of the Fan;</i>
which I will communicate to you, if you think it may be of use
to the Publick. I shall have a general Review on <i>Thursday</i>
next; to which you shall be very welcome if you will honour it
with your Presence.</p>

<p><i>I am</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i> I teach young Gentlemen the whole Art of Gallanting
a Fan.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i> I have several little plain Fans made for this Use, to
avoid Expence.</p>

<h2><a name="AELIANUS_CLAUDIUS"></a>AELIANUS CLAUDIUS</h2>

<h3>(Second Century A.D.)</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ccording to his 'Varia Historia,' Aelianus Claudius was a
native of Praeneste and a citizen of Rome, at the time of
the emperor Hadrian. He taught Greek rhetoric at Rome,
and hence was known as &quot;the Sophist.&quot; He spoke and wrote Greek
with the fluency and ease of a native Athenian, and gained thereby
the epithet of &quot;the honey-tongued&quot;. He lived to be sixty years of
age, and never married because he would not incur the responsibility
of children.</p>

<p>The 'Varia Historia' is the most noteworthy of his works. It is
a curious and interesting collection of short narratives, anecdotes,
and other historical, biographical, and antiquarian matter, selected
from the Greek authors whom he said he loved to study. And it
is valuable because it preserves scraps of works now lost. The
extracts are either in the words of the original, or give the compiler's
version; for, as he says, he liked to have his own way and
to follow his own taste. They are grouped without method; but in
this very lack of order--which shows that &quot;browsing&quot; instinct which
Charles Lamb declared to be essential to a right feeling for literature--the
charm of the book lies. This habit of straying, and his
lack of style, prove Aelianus more of a vagabond in the domain of
letters than a rhetorician.</p>

<p>His other important book, 'De Animalium Natura' (On the Nature
of Animals), is a medley of his own observations, both in Italy and
during his travels as far as Egypt. For several hundred years it
was a popular and standard book on zo&ouml;logy; and even as late as the
fourteenth century, Manuel Philes, a Byzantine poet, founded upon it
a poem on animals. Like the 'Varia Historia', it is scrappy and
gossiping. He leaps from subject to subject: from elephants to
dragons, from the liver of mice to the uses of oxen. There was,
however, method in this disorder; for as he says, he sought thereby
to give variety and hold his reader's attention. The book is interesting,
moreover, as giving us a personal glimpse of the man and of
his methods of work; for in a concluding chapter he states the general
principle on which he composed: that he has spent great labor,
thought, and care in writing it; that he has preferred the pursuit of
knowledge to the pursuit of wealth; that for his part, he found more
pleasure in observing the habits of the lion, the panther, and the
fox, in listening to the song of the nightingale, and in studying the
migrations of cranes, than in mere heaping up of riches and finding
himself numbered among the great; and that throughout his work
he has sought to adhere to the truth.</p>

<p>Aelianus was more of a moralizer than an artist in words; his
style has no distinctive literary qualities, and in both of his chief
works is the evident intention to set forth religious and moral principles.
He wrote, moreover, some treatises expressly on religious
and philosophic subjects, and some letters on husbandry.</p>

<p>The 'Varia Historia' has been twice translated into English: by
Abraham Fleming in 1576, and by Thomas Stanley, son of the poet
and philosopher Stanley, in 1665. Fleming was a poet and scholar
of the English Renaissance, who translated from the ancients, and
made a digest of Holinshed's 'Historie of England.' His version of
Aelianus loses nothing by its quaint wording, as will be seen from
the subjoined stories. The full title of the book is 'A Registre of
Hystories containing martiall Exploits of worthy Warriours, politique
Practices and civil Magistrates, wise Sentences of famous
Philosophers, and other Matters manifolde and memorable written in
Greek by Aelianus Claudius and delivered in English by Abraham
Fleming' (1576).</p>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS1"></a>OF CERTAIN NOTABLE MEN THAT MADE THEMSELVES PLAYFELLOWES
WITH CHILDREN</h3>
<br>

<p>Hercules (as some say) assuaged the tediousness of his labors,
which he sustayned in open and common games, with playing.
This Hercules, I say, being an incomparable warriour,
and the sonne of Jupiter and Latona, made himselfe a playfellowe
with boys. Euripides the poet introduceth, and bringeth in,
the selfe same god speaking in his owne person, and saying, &quot;I
play because choyce and chaunge of labors is delectable and
sweete unto me,&quot; whiche wordes he uttered holdinge a boy by
the hande. Socrates also was espied of Alcibiades upon a time,
playing with Lamprocles, who was in manner but a childe.
Agesilaus riding upon a rude, or cock-horse as they terme it,
played with his sonne beeing but a boy: and when a certayn man
passing by sawe him so doe and laughed there withall, Agesilaus
sayde thus, Now hold thy peace and say nothing; but when thou
art a father I doubt not thou wilt doe as fathers should doe with
their children. Architas Tarentinus being both in authoritie in
the commonwealth, that is to say a magestrat, and also a philosopher,
not of the obscurest sorte, but a precise lover of wisdom,
at that time he was a housband, a housekeeper, and maintained
many servauntes, he was greatly delighted with their younglinges,
used to play oftentimes with his servauntes' children, and was
wonte, when he was at dinner and supper, to rejoyce in the sight
and presence of them: yet was Tarentinus (as all men knowe) a
man of famous memorie and noble name.</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS2"></a>OF A CERTAINE SICILIAN WHOSE EYSIGHT WAS WOONDERFULL
SHARPE AND QUICK</h3>

<p>There was in Sicilia a certaine man indued with such sharpnesse,
quicknesse, and clearnesse of sight (if report may
challenge credite) that hee coulde see from Lilybaeus to
Carthage with such perfection and constancy that his eies coulde
not be deceived: and that he tooke true and just account of all
ships and vessels which went under sayle from Carthage, over-skipping
not so much as one in the universall number.</p>

<p>Something straunge it is that is recorded of Argus, a man
that had no lesse than an hundred eyes, unto whose custody Juno
committed Io, the daughter of Inachus, being transformed into a
young heifer: while Argus (his luck being such) was slaine sleeping,
but the Goddess Juno so provided that all his eyes (whatsoever
became of his carkasse) should be placed on the pecock's
taile; wherupon (sithence it came to passe) the pecock is called
Avis Junonia, or Lady Juno Birde. This historic is notable, but
yet the former (in mine opinion) is more memorable.</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS3"></a>THE LAWE OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS AGAINST COVETOUSNESS</h3>

<p>A certain young man of Lacedaemonia having bought a plot
of land for a small and easy price (and, as they say, dogge
cheape) was arrested to appear before the magistrates, and
after the trial of his matter he was charged with a penalty. The
reason why hee was judged worthy this punishment was because
he being but a young man gaped so gredely after gain and
yawned after filthy covetousness. For yt was a most commendable
thing among the Lacedaemonians not only to fighte against
the enemie in battell manfully; but also to wrestle and struggle
with covetousness (that misschievous monster) valliauntly.</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS4"></a>THAT SLEEP IS THE BROTHER OF DEATH, AND OF GORGIAS
DRAWING TO HIS END</h3>

<p>Gorgias Leontinus looking towardes the end of his life and
beeing wasted with the weaknes and wearysomenesse of
drooping olde age, falling into sharp and sore sicknesse
upon a time slumbered and slept upon his soft pillowe a little season.
Unto whose chamber a familiar freend of his resorting to
visit him in his sicknes demaunded how he felt himself affected in
body. To whom Gorgias Leontinus made this pithy and plausible
answeer, &quot;Now Sleep beginneth to deliver me up into the
jurisdiction of his brother-germane, Death.&quot;</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS5"></a>OF THE VOLUNTARY AND WILLING DEATH OF CALANUS</h3>

<p>The ende of Calanus deserveth no lesse commendation than it
procureth admiration; it is no less praiseworthy than it was
worthy wonder. The manner, therefore, was thus. The
within-named Calanus, being a sophister of India, when he had
taken his long leave and last farewell of Alexander, King of
Macedonia, and of his life in lyke manner, being willing, desirous,
and earnest to set himselfe at lybertie from the cloggs, chaines,
barres, boults, and fetters of the prison of the body, pyled up a
bonnefire in the suburbs of Babylon of dry woodde and chosen
sticks provided of purpose to give a sweete savour and an
odoriferous smell in burning. The kindes of woodde which hee
used to serve his turne in this case were these: Cedre, Rosemary,
Cipres, Mirtle, and Laurell. These things duely ordered,
he buckled himselfe to his accustomed exercise, namely, running
and leaping into the middest of the wodstack he stoode bolte
upright, having about his head a garlande made of the greene
leaves of reedes, the sunne shining full in his face, as he stoode
in the pile of stycks, whose glorious majesty, glittering with
bright beams of amiable beuty, he adored and worshipped. Furthermore
he gave a token and signe to the Macedonians to kindle
the fire, which, when they had done accordingly, hee beeing compassed
round about with flickering flames, stoode stoutly and
valiauntly in one and the selfe same place, and dyd not shrincke
one foote, until hee gave up the ghost, whereat Alexander unvailyng,
as at a rare strange sight and worldes wonder, saide
(as the voice goes) these words:--&quot;Calanus hath subdued, overcome,
and vanquished stronger enemies than I. For Alexander
made warre against Porus, Taxiles, and Darius. But Calanus did
denounce and did battell to labor and fought fearcely and manfully
with death.&quot;</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS6"></a>OF DELICATE DINNERS, SUMPTUOUS SUPPERS, AND PRODIGALL
BANQUETING</h3>

<p>Timothy, the son of Conon, captain of the Athenians, leaving
his sumptuous fare and royall banqueting, beeing desired
and intertained of Plato to a feast philosophicall, seasoned
with contentation and musick, at his returning home from that
supper of Plato, he said unto his familiar freends:--&quot;They whiche
suppe with Plato, this night, are not sick or out of temper the
next day following;&quot; and presently upon the enunciation of that
speech, Timothy took occasion to finde fault with great dinners,
suppers, feasts, and banquets, furnished with excessive fare, immoderate
consuming of meats, delicates, dainties, toothsome junkets,
and such like, which abridge the next dayes joy, gladnes,
delight, mirth, and pleasantnes. Yea, that sentence is consonant
and agreeable to the former, and importeth the same sense notwithstanding
in words it hath a little difference. That the within
named Timothy meeting the next day after with Plato said to
him:--&quot;You philosophers, freend Plato, sup better the day following
than the night present.&quot;</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS7"></a>OF BESTOWING TIME, AND HOW WALKING UP AND DOWNE
WAS NOT ALLOWABLE AMONG THE LACEDAEMONIANS</h3>

<p>The Lacedaemonians were of this judgment, that measureable
spending of time was greatly to be esteemed, and therefore
did they conforme and apply themselves to any kinde of
laboure moste earnestly and painfully, not withdrawing their hands
from works of much bodyly mooving, not permitting any particular
person, beeing a citizen, to spend the time in idlenes, to waste
it in unthrifty gaming, to consume it in trifling, in vain toyes and
lewd loytering, all whiche are at variance and enmity with vertue.
Of this latter among many testimonyes, take this for one.</p>

<p>When it was reported to the magistrates of the Lacedaemonians
called Ephori, in manner of complaint, that the inhabitants
of Deceleia used afternoone walkings, they sent unto them messengers
with their commandmente, saying:--&quot;Go not up and
doune like loyterers, nor walke not abrode at your pleasure, pampering
the wantonnes of your natures rather than accustoming
yourself to exercises of activity. For it becometh the Lacedaemonians
to regarde their health and to maintaine their safety not
with walking to and fro, but with bodily labours.&quot;</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS8"></a>HOW SOCRATES SUPPRESSED THE PRYDE AND HAUTINESSE
OF ALCIBIADES</h3>

<p>Socrates, seeing Alcibiades puft up with pryde and broyling in
ambitious behavioure (because possessor of such great wealth
and lorde of so large lands) brought him to a place where
a table did hang containing a discription of the worlde universall.
Then did Socrates will Alcibiades to seeke out the situation of
Athens, which when he found Socrates proceeded further and
willed him to point out that plot of ground where his lands and
lordships lay. Alcibiades, having sought a long time and yet
never the nearer, sayde to Socrates that his livings were not set
forth in that table, nor any discription of his possession therein
made evident. When Socrates, rebuked with this secret quip:
&quot;And art thou so arrogant (sayeth he) and so hautie in heart for
that which is no parcell of the world?&quot;</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="AELIANUS9"></a>OF CERTAINE WASTGOODES AND SPENDTHRIFTES</h3>

<p>Prodigall lavishing of substance, unthrifty and wastifull spending,
voluptuousness of life and palpable sensuality brought
Pericles, Callias, the sonne of Hipponicus, and Nicias not
only to necessitie, but to povertie and beggerie. Who, after their
money waxed scant, and turned to a very lowe ebbe, they three
drinking a poysoned potion one to another (which was the last
cuppe that they kissed with their lippes) passed out of this life
(as it were from a banquet) to the powers infernall.</p>

<h2><a name="AESCHINES"></a>AESCHINES</h2>

<h3>(389-314 B.C.)</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he life and oratory of Aeschines fall fittingly into that period
of Greek history when the free spirit of the people which
had created the arts of Pindar and Sophocles, Pericles, Phidias,
and Plato, was becoming the spirit of slaves and of savants, who
sought to forget the freedom of their fathers in learning, luxury,
and the formalism of deducers of rules. To this slavery Aeschines
himself contributed, both in action with Philip of Macedon and in
speech. Philip had entered upon a career of conquest; a policy
legitimate in itself and beneficial as judged by
its larger fruits, but ruinous to the advanced
civilization existing in the Greek City-States
below, whose high culture was practically confiscated
to spread out over a waste of semi-barbarism
and mix with alien cultures. Among
his Greek sympathizers, Aeschines was perhaps
his chief support in the conquest of the Greek
world that lay to the south within his reach.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/192.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>Aeschines was born in 389 B.C., six years
before his lifelong rival Demosthenes. If we
may trust that rival's elaborate details of his
early life, his father taught a primary school
and his mother was overseer of certain initiatory
rites, to both of which occupations Aeschines gave his youthful
hand and assistance. He became in time a third-rate actor, and the
duties of clerk or scribe presently made him familiar with the executive
and legislative affairs of Athens. Both vocations served as an
apprenticeship to the public speaking toward which his ambition was
turning. We hear of his serving as a heavy-armed soldier in various
Athenian expeditions, and of his being privileged to carry to Athens,
in 349 B.C., the first news of the victory of Tamynae, in Euboea, in
reward for the bravery he had shown in the battle.</p>

<p>Two years afterward he was sent as an envoy into the Peloponnesus,
with the object of forming a union of the Greeks against Philip
for the defense of their liberties. But his mission was unsuccessful.
Toward the end of the same year he served as one of the ten
ambassadors sent to Philip to discuss terms of peace. The harangues
of the Athenians at this meeting were followed in turn by a speech
of Philip, whose openness of manner, pertinent arguments, and pretended
desire for a settlement led to a second embassy, empowered
to receive from him the oath of allegiance and peace. It was during
this second embassy that Demothenes says he discovered the
philippizing spirit and foul play of Aeschines. Upon their return to
Athens, Aeschines rose before the assembly to assure the people that
Philip had come to Thermopylae as the friend and ally of Athens.
&quot;We, your envoys, have satisfied him,&quot; said Aeschines. &quot;You will
hear of benefits still more direct which we have determined Philip
to confer upon you, but which it would not be prudent as yet to
specify.&quot;</p>

<p>But the alarm of the Athenians at the presence of Philip within
the gates was not allayed. The king, however, anxious to temporize
with them until he could receive his army supplies by sea, suborned
Aeschines, who assured his countrymen of Philip's peaceful intentions.
On another occasion, by an inflammatory speech at Delphi, he so
played upon the susceptibilities of the rude Amphictyones that they
rushed forth, uprooted their neighbors' harvest fields, and began a
devastating war of Greek against Greek. Internal dissensions promised
the shrewd Macedonian the conquest he sought. At length, in
August, 338, came Philip's victory at Chaeronea, and the complete
prostration of Greek power. Aeschines, who had hitherto disclaimed
all connection with Philip, now boasted of his intimacy with the
king. As Philip's friend, while yet an Athenian, he offered himself
as ambassador to entreat leniency from the victor toward the unhappy
citizens.</p>

<p>The memorable defense of Demosthenes against the attack of
Aeschines was delivered in 330 B.C. Seven years before this, Ctesiphon
had proposed to the Senate that the patriotic devotion and
labors of Demosthenes should be acknowledged by the gift of a
golden crown--a recognition willingly accorded. But as this decision,
to be legal, must be confirmed by the Assembly, Aeschines gave
notice that he would proceed against Ctesiphon for proposing an
unconstitutional measure. He managed to postpone action on the
notice for six years. At last he seized a moment when the victories
of Philip's son and successor, Alexander, were swaying popular
feeling, to deliver a bitter harangue against the whole life and policy
of his political opponent. Demosthenes answered in that magnificent
oration called by the Latin writers 'De Corona' Aeschines was
not upheld by the people's vote. He retired to Asia, and, it is said,
opened a school of rhetoric at Rhodes. There is a legend that after
he had one day delivered in his school the masterpiece of his enemy,
his students broke into applause: &quot;What,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;if you
had heard the wild beast thunder it out himself!&quot;</p>

<p>Aeschines was what we call nowadays a self-made man. The great
faults of his life, his philippizing policy and his confessed corruption,
arose, doubtless, from the results of youthful poverty: a covetousness
growing out of want, and a lack of principles of conduct which a
broader education would have instilled. As an orator he was second
only to Demosthenes; and while he may at times be compared to
his rival in intellectual force and persuasiveness, his moral defects--which
it must be remembered that he himself acknowledged--make
a comparison of character impossible.</p>

<p>His chief works remaining to us are the speeches 'Against Timarchus,'
'On the Embassy,' 'Against Ctesiphon,' and letters, which are
included in the edition of G.E. Benseler (1855-60). In his 'History of
Greece,' Grote discusses at length--of course adversely--the influence
of Aeschines; especially controverting Mitford's favorable view and
his denunciation of Demosthenes and the patriotic party. The trend
of recent writing is toward Mitford's estimate of Philip's policy,
and therefore less blame for the Greek statesmen who supported it,
though without Mitford's virulence toward its opponents. Mahaffy
('Greek Life and Thought') holds the whole contest over the crown
to be mere academic threshing of old straw, the fundamental issues
being obsolete by the rise of a new world under Alexander.</p>


<br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br>
<h3><a name="A_DEFENSE_AND_AN_ATTACK"></a>A DEFENSE AND AN ATTACK</h3>

<center>From the 'Oration against Ctesiphon'</center>
<br>

<p>In regard to the calumnies with which I am attacked, I wish
to say a word or two before Demosthenes speaks. He will
allege, I am told, that the State has received distinguished
services from him, while from me it has suffered injury on
many occasions; and that the deeds of Philip and Alexander,
and the crimes to which they gave rise, are to be imputed to me.
Demosthenes is so clever in the art of speaking that he does not
bring accusation against me, against any point in my conduct of
affairs or any counsels I may have brought to our public meetings;
but he rather casts reflections upon my private life, and
charges me with a criminal silence.</p>

<p>Moreover, in order that no circumstance may escape his calumny,
he attacks my habits of life when I was in school with my
young companions; and even in the introduction of his speech
he will say that I have begun this prosecution, not for the benefit
of the State, but because I want to make a show of myself to
Alexander and gratify Alexander's resentment against him. He
purposes, as I learn, to ask why I blame his administration as a
whole, and yet never hindered or indicted any one separate act;
why, after a considerable interval of attention to public affairs,
I now return to prosecute this action....</p>

<p>But what I am now about to notice--a matter which I hear
Demosthenes will speak of--about this, by the Olympian deities,
I cannot but feel a righteous indignation. He will liken my
speech to the Sirens', it seems, and the legend anent their art is
that those who listen to them are not charmed, but destroyed;
wherefore the music of the Sirens is not in good repute. Even
so he will aver that knowledge of my words and myself is a
source of injury to those who listen to me. I, for my part, think
it becomes no one to urge such allegations against me; for it is
a shame if one who makes charges cannot point to facts as full
evidence. And if such charges must be made, the making surely
does not become Demosthenes, but rather some military man--some
man of action--who has done good work for the State, and
who, in his untried speech, vies with the skill of antagonists
because he is conscious that he can tell no one of his deeds, and
because he sees his accusers able to show his audience that he
had done what in fact he never had done. But when a man
made up entirely of words,--of sharp words and overwrought
sentences,--when he takes refuge in simplicity and plain facts, who
then can endure it?--whose tongue is like a flute, inasmuch as if
you take it away the rest is nothing....</p>

<p>This man thinks himself worthy of a crown--that his honor
should be proclaimed. But should you not rather send into exile
this common pest of the Greeks? Or will you not seize upon him
as a thief, and avenge yourself upon him whose mouthings have
enabled him to bear full sail through our commonwealth? Remember
the season in which you cast your vote. In a few days
the Pythian Games will come round, and the convention of the
Hellenic States will hold its sessions. Our State has been concerned
on account of the measures of Demosthenes regarding
present crises. You will appear, if you crown him, accessory to
those who broke the general peace. But if, on the other hand,
you refuse the crown, you will free the State from blame. Do
not take counsel as if it were for an alien, but as if it concerned,
as it does, the private interest of your city; and do not dispense
your honors carelessly, but with judgment; and let your public
gifts be the distinctive possession of men most worthy. Not only
hear, but also look around you and consider who are the men
who support Demosthenes. Are they his fellow-hunters, or his
associates in old athletic sports? No, by Olympian Zeus, he was
never engaged in hunting the wild boar, nor in care for the
well-being of his body; but he was toiling at the art of those
who keep up possessions.</p>

<p>Take into consideration also his art of juggling, when he says
that by his embassy he wrested Byzantium from the hands of
Philip, and that his eloquence led the Acarnanians to revolt, and
struck dumb the Thebans. He thinks, forsooth, that you have
fallen to such a degree of weakness that he can persuade you
that you have been entertaining Persuasion herself in your city,
and not a vile slanderer. And when at the conclusion of his
argument he calls upon his partners in bribe-taking, then fancy
that you see upon these steps, from which I now address you,
the benefactors of your State arrayed against the insolence of
those men. Solon, who adorned our commonwealth with most
noble laws, a man who loved wisdom, a worthy legislator, asking
you in dignified and sober manner, as became his character,
not to follow the pleading of Demosthenes rather than your
oaths and laws. Aristides, who assigned to the Greeks their
tributes, to whose daughters after he had died the people gave
portions--imagine Aristides complaining bitterly at the insult to
public justice, and asking if you are not ashamed that when your
fathers banished Arthurias the Zelian, who brought gold from
the Medes (although while he was sojourning in the city and a
guest of the people of Athens they were scarce restrained from
killing him, and by proclamation forbade him the city and any
dominion the Athenians had power over), nevertheless that you
are going to crown Demosthenes, who did not indeed bring gold
from the Medes, but who received bribes and has them still in
his possession. And Themistocles and those who died at Marathon
and at Plataea, and the very graves of your ancestors--will
they not cry out if you venture to grant a crown to one who
confesses that he united with the barbarians against the Greeks?</p>

<p>And now, O earth and sun! virtue and intelligence! and thou,
O genius of the humanities, who teachest us to judge between
the noble and the ignoble, I have come to your succor and I
have done. If I have made my pleading with dignity and
worthily, as I looked to the flagrant wrong which called it forth,
I have spoken as I wished. If I have done ill, it was as I was
able. Do you weigh well my words and all that is left unsaid,
and vote in accordance with justice and the interests of the city!</p>

<h2><a name="AESCHYLUS"></a>AESCHYLUS</h2>

<h3>(B.C. 525-456)</h3>

<h3>BY JOHN WILLIAMS WHITE</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he mightiest of Greek tragic poets was the son of Euphorion,
an Athenian noble, and was born B.C. 525. When he was a
lad of eleven, the tyrant Hipparchus fell in a public street
of Athens under the daggers of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. Later,
Aeschylus saw the family of tyrants, which for fifty years had ruled
Attica with varying fortunes, banished from the land. With a boy's
eager interest he followed the establishment of the Athenian democracy
by Cleisthenes. He grew to manhood in stirring times. The
new State was engaged in war with
the powerful neighboring island of
Aegina; on the eastern horizon was
gathering the cloud that was to burst
in storm at Marathon, Aeschylus was
trained in that early school of Athenian
greatness whose masters were
Miltiades, Aristides, and Themistocles.</p>

<p class="rgt"><img src="images/197.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>During the struggle with Persia,
fought out on Greek soil, the poet
was at the height of his physical
powers, and we may feel confidence
in the tradition that he fought not
only at Marathon, but also at Salamis.
Two of his extant tragedies
breathe the very spirit of war, and
show a soldier's experience; and the epitaph upon his tomb, which
was said to have been written by himself, recorded how he had been
one of those who met the barbarians in the first shock of the great
struggle and had helped to save his country.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">&quot;How brave in battle was Euphorion's son,</p>
<p>The long-haired Mede can tell who fell at Marathon.&quot;</p>
</div></div>

<p>Before Aeschylus, Attic tragedy had been essentially lyrical. It
arose from the dithyrambic chorus that was sung at the festivals of
Dionysus. Thespis had introduced the first actor, who, in the pauses
of the choral song, related in monologue the adventures of the god
or engaged in dialogue with the leader of the chorus. To Aeschylus
is due the invention of the second actor. This essentially changed the
character of the performance. The dialogue could now be carried on
by the two actors, who were thus able to enact a complete story.
The functions of the chorus became less important, and the lyrical
element was subordinated to the action. (The word &quot;drama&quot; signifies
action.) The number of actors was subsequently increased to
three, and Aeschylus in his later plays used this number. This restriction
imposed upon the Greek playwright does not mean that he
was limited to two or three characters in his play, but that only two,
or at the most three, of these might take part in the action at once.
The same actor might assume different parts. The introduction of
the second actor was so capital an innovation that it rightly entitles
Aeschylus to be regarded as the creator of the drama, for in his
hands tragedy first became essentially dramatic. This is his great
distinction, but his powerful genius wrought other changes. He perfected,
if he did not discover, the practice of introducing three plays
upon a connected theme (technically named a <i>trilogy</i>), with an after-piece
of lighter character. He invented the tragic dress and buskin,
and perfected the tragic mask. He improved the tragic dance, and
by his use of scenic decoration and stage machinery, secured effects
that were unknown before him. His chief claim to superior excellence,
however, lies after all in his poetry. Splendid in diction, vivid
in the portraiture of character, and powerful in the expression of
passion, he is regarded by many competent critics as the greatest
tragic poet of all time.</p>

<p>The Greek lexicographer, Suidas, reports that Aeschylus wrote
ninety plays. The titles of seventy-two of these have been handed
down in an ancient register. He brought out the first of these at
the age of twenty-five, and as he died at the age of sixty-nine, he
wrote on an average two plays each year throughout his lifetime.
Such fertility would be incredible, were not similar facts authentically
recorded of the older tragic poets of Greece. The Greek
drama, moreover, made unusual demands on the creative powers of
the poet. It was lyrical, and the lyrics were accompanied by the
dance. All these elements--poetry, song, and dance--the poet contributed;
and we gain a new sense of the force of the word &quot;poet&quot;
(it means &quot;creator&quot;), when we contemplate his triple function.
Moreover, he often &quot;staged&quot; the play himself, and sometimes he
acted in it. Aeschylus was singularly successful in an age that produced
many great poets. He took the first prize at least thirteen
times; and as he brought out four plays at each contest, more than
half his plays were adjudged by his contemporaries to be of the
highest quality. After the poet's death, plays which he had written,
but which had not been acted in his lifetime, were brought out
by his sons and a nephew. It is on record that his son Euphorion
took the first prize four times with plays of his father; so the poet's
art lived after him and suffered no eclipse.</p>

<p>Only seven complete plays of Aeschylus are still extant. The
best present source of the text of these is a manuscript preserved in
the Laurentian Library, at Florence in Italy, which was written in
the tenth or eleventh century after Christ. The number of plays
still extant is small, but fortunately, among them is the only complete
Greek trilogy that we possess, and luckily also the other four
serve to mark successive stages in the poet's artistic development.
The trilogy of the 'Oresteia' is certainly his masterpiece; in some of
the other plays he is clearly seen to be still bound by the limitations
which hampered the earlier writers of Greek tragedy. In the following
analysis the seven plays will be presented in their probable
chronological order.</p>

<p>The Greeks signally defeated Xerxes in the great sea fight in the
bay of Salamis, B.C. 480. The poet made this victory the theme of
his 'Persians.' This is the only historical Greek tragedy which we
now possess: the subjects of all the rest are drawn from mythology.
But Aeschylus had a model for his historical play in the 'Phoenician
Women' of his predecessor Phrynichus, which dealt with the
same theme. Aeschylus, indeed, is said to have imitated it closely
in the 'Persians.' Plagiarism was thought to be a venial fault by
the ancients, just as in the Homeric times piracy was not considered
a disgrace. The scene of the play is not Athens, as one might
expect, but Susa. It opens without set prologue. The Chorus consists
of Persian elders, to whom the government of the country has
been committed in the absence of the King. These venerable men
gather in front of the royal palace, and their leader opens the play
with expressions of apprehension: no news has come from the host
absent in Greece. The Chorus at first express full confidence in the
resistless might of the great army; but remembering that the gods
are jealous of vast power and success in men, yield to gloomy forebodings.
These grow stronger when Atossa, the aged mother of
Xerxes, appears from the palace and relates the evil dreams which
she has had on the previous night, and the omen that followed. The
Chorus beseech her to make prayer to the gods, to offer libations to
the dead, and especially to invoke the spirit of Darius to avert the
evil which threatens his ancient kingdom. Too late! A messenger
arrives and announces that all is lost. By one fell stroke the might
of Persia has been laid low at Salamis. At Atossa's request, the messenger,
interrupted at first by the lamentations of the Chorus, recounts
what has befallen. His description of the battle in the straits is a
passage of signal power, and is justly celebrated. The Queen retires,
and the Chorus sing a song full of gloomy reflections. The Queen
reappears, and the ghost of Darius is invoked from the lower world.
He hears from Atossa what has happened, sees in this the fulfillment
of certain ancient prophecies, foretells disaster still to come,
and warns the Chorus against further attempts upon Greece. As he
departs to the underworld, the Chorus sing in praise of the wisdom
of his reign. Atossa has withdrawn. Xerxes now appears with
attendants, laments with the Chorus the disaster that has overtaken
him, and finally enters the palace.</p>

<p>The economy of the play is simple: only two actors are required.
The first played the parts of Atossa and Xerxes, the second that of
the messenger and the ghost of Darius. The play well illustrates
the conditions under which Aeschylus at this period wrote. The
Chorus was still of first importance; the ratio of the choral parts in
the play to the dialogue is about one to two.</p>

<p>The exact date of the 'Suppliants' cannot be determined; but the
simplicity of its plot, the lack of a prologue, the paucity of its
characters, and the prominence of the Chorus, show that it is an early
play. The scene is Argos. The Chorus consists of the daughters of
Dana&uuml;s, and there are only three characters,--Dana&uuml;s, a Herald, and
Pelasgus King of Argos.</p>

<p>Dana&uuml;s and Aegyptus, brothers, and descendants of Io and Epaphus,
had settled near Canopus at the mouth of the Nile. Aegyptus
sought to unite his fifty sons in marriage with the fifty daughters of
the brother. The daughters fled with their father to Argos. Here
his play opens. The Chorus appeal for protection to the country,
once the home of Io, and to its gods and heroes. Pelasgus, with the
consent of the Argive people, grants them refuge, and at the end of
the play repels the attempt to seize them made by the Herald of the
sons of Aegyptus.</p>

<p>A part of one of the choruses is of singular beauty, and it is
doubtless to them that the preservation of the play is due. The
play hardly seems to be a tragedy, for it ends without bloodshed.
Further, it lacks dramatic interest, for the action almost stands still.
It is a cantata rather than a tragedy. Both considerations, however,
are sufficiently explained by the fact that this was the first play of a
trilogy. The remaining plays must have furnished, in the death of
forty-nine of the sons of Aegyptus, both action and tragedy in sufficient
measure to satisfy the most exacting demands.</p>

<p>The 'Seven Against Thebes' deals with the gloomy myth of the
house of La&iuml;us. The tetralogy to which it belonged consisted of the
'La&iuml;us,' 'Oedipus,' 'Seven Against Thebes,' and 'Sphinx.' The
themes of Greek tragedy were drawn from the national mythology,
but the myths were treated with a free hand. In his portrayal of
the fortunes of this doomed race, Aeschylus departed in important
particulars, with gain in dramatic effect, from the story as it is read
in Homer.</p>

<p>Oedipus had pronounced an awful curse upon his sons, Eteocles
and Polynices, for their unfilial neglect,--&quot;they should one day
divide their land by steel.&quot; They thereupon agreed to reign in
turn, each for a year; but Eteocles, the elder, refused at the end of
the first year to give up the throne. Polynices appealed to Adrastus
King of Argos for help, and seven chiefs appeared before the walls
of Thebes to enforce his claim, and beleaguered the town. Here
the play opens, with an appeal addressed by Eteocles to the citizens
of Thebes to prove themselves stout defenders of their State in its
hour of peril. A messenger enters, and describes the sacrifice and
oath of the seven chiefs. The Chorus of Theban maidens enter in
confusion and sing the first ode. The hostile army is hurrying from
its camp against the town; the Chorus hear their shouts and the
rattling din of their arms, and are overcome by terror. Eteocles
reproves them for their fears, and bids them sing a paean that shall
hearten the people. The messenger, in a noteworthy scene, describes
the appearance of each hostile chief. The seventh and last
is Polynices. Eteocles, although conscious of his father's curse,
nevertheless declares with gloomy resoluteness that he will meet his
brother in single combat, and, resisting the entreaties of the Chorus,
goes forth to his doom. The attack on the town is repelled, but
the brothers fall, each by the other's hand. Thus is the curse fulfilled.
Presently their bodies are wheeled in. Their sisters, Antigone
and Ismene, follow and sing a lament over the dead. A herald announces
that the Theban Senate forbid the burial of Polynices; his
body shall be cast forth as prey of dogs. Antigone declares her
resolution to brave their mandate, and perform the last sad rites for
her brother.</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Dread tie, the common womb from which we sprang,--<br>
Of wretched mother born and hapless sire.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>The Chorus divides. The first semi-chorus sides with Antigone;
the second declares its resolution to follow to its last resting-place
the body of Eteocles. And thus the play ends. The theme is here
sketched, just at the close of the play, in outline, that Sophocles
has developed with such pathetic effect in his 'Antigone.'</p>

<p>The 'Prometheus' transports the reader to another world. The
characters are gods, the time is the remote past, the place a desolate
waste in Scythia, on the confines of the Northern Ocean. Prometheus
had sinned against the authority of Zeus. Zeus wished to
destroy the old race of mankind; but Prometheus gave them fire,
taught them arts and handicrafts, developed in them thought and
consciousness, and so assured both their existence and their happiness.
The play deals with his punishment. Prometheus is borne
upon the scene by Force and Strength, and is nailed to a lofty cliff
by Hephaestus. His appeal to Nature, when his tormentors depart
and he is left alone, is peculiarly pathetic. The daughters of Oceanus,
constituting the Chorus, who have heard the sound of the hammer
in their ocean cave, are now borne in aloft on a winged car,
and bewail the fate of the outraged god. Oceanus appears upon a
winged steed, and offers his mediation; but this is scornfully rejected.
The resolution of Prometheus to resist Zeus to the last is strengthened
by the coming of Io. She too, as it seems, is a victim of the
Ruler of the Universe; driven by the jealous wrath of Hera, she
roams from land to land. She tells the tale of her sad wandering,
and finally rushes from the scene in frenzy, crazed by the sting of
the gadfly that Hera has sent to torment her. Prometheus knows a
secret full of menace to Zeus. Relying on this, he prophesies his
overthrow, and defies him to do his worst. Hermes is sent to demand
with threats its revelation, but fails to accomplish his purpose.
Prometheus insults and taunts him. Hermes warns the Chorus to
leave, for Zeus is about to display his wrath. At first they refuse,
but then fly affrighted: the cliff is rending and sinking, the elements
are in wild tumult. As he sinks, about to be engulfed in the bowels
of the earth, Prometheus cries:--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i7">&quot;Earth is rocking in space!</p>
<p>And the thunders crash up with a roar upon roar,</p>
<p class="i1">And the eddying lightnings flash fire in my face,</p>
<p>And the whirlwinds are whirling the dust round and round,</p>
<p class="i1">And the blasts of the winds universal leap free</p>
<p>And blow each upon each with a passion of sound,</p>
<p class="i1">And aether goes mingling in storm with the sea.&quot;</p>
</div></div>

<p>The play is Titanic. Its huge shapes, its weird effects, its mighty
passions, its wild display of the forces of earth and air,--these impress
us chiefly at first; but its ethical interest is far greater. Zeus
is apparently represented in it as relentless, cruel, and unjust,--a
lawless ruler, who knows only his own will,--whereas in all the
other plays of Aeschylus he is just and righteous, although sometimes
severe. Aeschylus, we know, was a religious man. It seems incredible
that he should have had two contradictory conceptions of the
character of Zeus. The solution of this problem is to be found in
the fact that this 'Prometheus' was the first play of the trilogy. In
the second play, the 'Prometheus Unbound,' of which we have only
fragments, these apparent contradictions must have been reconciled.
Long ages are supposed to elapse between the plays. Prometheus
yields. He reveals the secret and is freed from his bonds. What
before seemed to be relentless wanton cruelty is now seen to have
been only the harsh but necessary severity of a ruler newly established
on his throne. By the reconciliation of this stern ruler with
the wise Titan, the giver of good gifts to men, order is restored to
the universe. Prometheus acknowledges his guilt, and the course
of Zeus is vindicated; but the loss of the second play of the trilogy
leaves much in doubt, and an extraordinary number of solutions of
the problem has been proposed. The reader must not look for one
of these, however, in the 'Prometheus Unbound' of Shelley, who
deliberately rejected the supposition of a reconciliation.</p>

<p>The three remaining plays are founded on the woful myth of the
house of Atreus, son of Pelops, a theme much treated by the Greek
tragic poets. They constitute the only existing Greek trilogy, and
are the last and greatest work of the poet. They were brought out
at Athens, B.C. 458, two years after the author's death. The 'Agamemnon'
sets forth the crime,--the murder, by his wife, of the
great King, on his return home from Troy; the 'Cho&euml;phori,' the vengeance
taken on the guilty wife by her own son; the 'Eumenides,' the
atonement made by that son in expiation of his mother's murder.</p>

<p>Agamemnon on departing for Troy left behind him in his palace
a son and a daughter, Orestes and Electra. Orestes was exiled from
home by his mother Clytemnestra, who in Agamemnon's absence
lived in guilty union with Aegisthus, own cousin of the King, and
who could no longer endure to look upon the face of her son.</p>

<p>The scene of the 'Agamemnon' is the royal palace in Argos.
The time is night. A watchman is discovered on the flat roof of
the palace. For a year he has kept weary vigil there, waiting for
the beacon-fire that, sped from mountain-top to mountain-top, shall
announce the fall of Troy. The signal comes at last, and joyously
he proclaims the welcome news. The sacrificial fires which have
been made ready in anticipation of the event are set alight throughout
the city. The play naturally falls into three divisions. The
first introduces the Chorus of Argive elders, Clytemnestra, and a
Herald who tells of the hardships of the siege and of the calamitous
return, and ends with the triumphal entrance of Agamemnon with
Cassandra, and his welcome by the Queen; the second comprehends
the prophecy of the frenzied Cassandra of the doom about to fall
upon the house and the murder of the King; the third the conflict
between the Chorus, still faithful to the murdered King, and Clytemnestra,
beside whom stands her paramour Aegisthus.</p>

<p>Interest centres in Clytemnestra. Crafty, unscrupulous, resolute,
remorseless, she veils her deadly hatred for her lord, and welcomes
him home in tender speech:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;So now, dear lord, I bid thee welcome home--<br>
True as the faithful watchdog of the fold,<br>
Strong as the mainstay of the laboring bark,<br>
Stately as column, fond as only child,<br>
Dear as the land to shipwrecked mariner,<br>
Bright as fair sunshine after winter's storms,<br>
Sweet as fresh fount to thirsty wanderer--<br>
All this, and more, thou art, dear love, to me.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Agamemnon passes within the palace; she slays him in his bath,
enmeshed in a net, and then, reappearing, vaunts her bloody deed:</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;I smote him, and he bellowed; and again<br>
I smote, and with a groan his knees gave way;<br>
And as he fell before me, with a third<br>
And last libation from the deadly mace,<br>
I pledged the crowning draught to Hades due,<br>
That subterranean Saviour--of the dead!<br>
At which he spouted up the Ghost in such<br>
A flood of purple as, bespattered with,<br>
No less did I rejoice than the green ear<br>
Rejoices in the largesse of the skies<br>
That fleeting Iris follows as it flies.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Aeschylus departs from the Homeric account, which was followed
by other poets, in making the action of the next play, the 'Cho&euml;phori,'
follow closer upon that of the 'Agamemnon.' Orestes has
heard in Phocis of his father's murder, and returns in secret, with
his friend Pylades, to exact vengeance. The scene is still Argos,
but Agamemnon's tomb is now seen in front of the palace. The
Chorus consists of captive women, who aid and abet the attempt.
The play sets forth the recognition of Orestes by Electra; the plot
by which Orestes gains admission to the palace; the deceit of the
old Nurse, a homely but capital character, by whom Aegisthus is
induced to come to the palace without armed attendants; the death
of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra; the appearance of the avenging
Furies; and the flight of Orestes.</p>

<p>The last play of the trilogy, the 'Eumenides,' has many singular
features. The Chorus of Furies seemed even to the ancients to be
a weird and terrible invention; the scene of the play shifts from
Delphi to Athens; the poet introduces into the play a trial scene;
and he had in it a distinct political purpose, whose development
occupies one-half of the drama.</p>

<p>Orestes, pursued by the avenging Furies, &quot;Gorgon-like, vested in
sable stoles, their locks entwined with clustering snakes,&quot; has fled to
Delphi to invoke the aid of Apollo. He clasps the navel-stone and
in his exhaustion falls asleep. Around him sleep the Furies. The
play opens with a prayer made by the Pythian priestess at an altar
in front of the temple. The interior of the sanctuary is then laid
bare. Orestes is awake, but the Furies sleep on. Apollo, standing
beside Orestes, promises to protect him, but bids him make all haste
to Athens, and there clasp, as a suppliant, the image of Athena.
Orestes flies. The ghost of Clytemnestra rises from the underworld,
and calls upon the Chorus to pursue. Overcome by their toil, they
moan in their sleep, but finally start to their feet. Apollo bids them
quit the temple.</p>

<p>The scene changes to the ancient temple of Athena on the
Acropolis at Athens, where Orestes is seen clasping the image of the
goddess. The Chorus enter in pursuit of their victim, and sing an ode
descriptive of their powers.</p>

<p>Athena appears, and learns from the Chorus and from Orestes the
reasons for their presence. She declares the issue to be too grave
even for her to decide, and determines to choose judges of the murder,
who shall become a solemn tribunal for all future time. These
are to be the best of the citizens of Athens. After an ode by the
Chorus, she returns, the court is established, and the trial proceeds
in due form. Apollo appears for the defense of Orestes. When the
arguments have been presented, Athena proclaims, before the vote
has been taken, the establishment of the court as a permanent tribunal
for the trial of cases of bloodshed. Its seat shall be the Areopagus.
The votes are cast and Orestes is acquitted. He departs for
Argos. The Furies break forth in anger and threaten woes to the
land, but are appeased by Athena, who establishes their worship forever
in Attica. Heretofore they have been the Erinnyes, or Furies;
henceforth they shall be the Eumenides, or Gracious Goddesses.
The Eumenides are escorted from the scene in solemn procession.</p>

<p>Any analysis of the plays so brief as the preceding is necessarily
inadequate. The English reader is referred to the histories of Greek
Literature by K.O. M&uuml;ller and by J.P. Mahaffy, to the striking
chapter on Aeschylus in J.A. Symonds's 'Greek Poets,' and, for the
trilogy, to Moulton's 'Ancient Classical Drama.' If he knows French,
he should add Croiset's 'Histoire de la Litt&eacute;rature Grecque,' and
should by all means read M. Patin's volume on Aeschylus in his
'&Eacute;tudes sur les Tragique Gr&egrave;cs.' There are translations in English
of the poet's complete works by Potter, by Plumptre, by Blackie,
and by Miss Swanwick. Flaxman illustrated the plays. Ancient
illustrations are easily accessible in Baumeister's 'Denkm&auml;ler,' under
the names of the different characters in the plays. There is a translation
of the 'Prometheus' by Mrs. Browning, and of the 'Suppliants'
by Morshead, who has also translated the Atridean trilogy under
the title of 'The House of Atreus.' Goldwin Smith has translated
portions of six of the plays in his 'Specimens of Greek Tragedy.'
Many translations of the 'Agamemnon' have been made, among others
by Milman, by Symmons, by Lord Carnarvon, and by Fitzgerald.
Robert Browning also translated the play, with appalling literalness.</p>

<p class="i2">And River-wells, and laughter innumerous</p>

<p class="i2">Behold, with throe on throe,</p>
<p class="i2">How, wasted by this woe,</p>
<p>I wrestle down the myriad years of Time!</p>
<p class="i2">Behold, how fast around me</p>
<p>The new King of the happy ones sublime</p>
<p>Has flung the chain he forged, has shamed and bound me!</p>
<p>Woe, woe! to-day's woe and the coming morrow's</p>
<p>I cover with one groan. And where is found me</p>
<p class="i2">A limit to these sorrows?</p>
<p>And yet what word do I say? I have foreknown</p>
<p>Clearly all things that should be; nothing done</p>
<p>Comes sudden to my soul--and I must bear</p>
<p>What is ordained with patience, being aware</p>
<p>Necessity doth front the universe</p>

<p>Hung here in fetters, 'neath the blanching sky.</p>
<p class="i2">Ah, ah me! what a sound,</p>
<p>What a fragrance sweeps up from a pinion unseen</p>
<p>Of a god, or a mortal, or nature between,</p>
<p>Sweeping up to this rock where the earth has her bound,</p>
<p>To have sight of my pangs, or some guerdon obtain--</p>
<p>Lo, a god in the anguish, a god in the chain!</p>
<p class="i2">The god Zeus hateth sore,</p>
<p class="i2">And his gods hate again,</p>
<p>As many as tread on his glorified floor,</p>
<p>Because I loved mortals too much evermore.</p>
<p>Alas me! what a murmur and motion I hear,</p>
<p class="i2">As of birds flying near!</p>

Now at the Seventh Gate the seventh chief,<br>
Thy proper mother's son, I will announce,<br>
What fortune for this city, for himself,<br>
With curses he invoketh:--on the walls<br>
Ascending, heralded as king, to stand,<br>
With paeans for their capture; then with thee<br>
To fight, and either slaying near thee die,<br>
Or thee, who wronged him, chasing forth alive,<br>
Requite in kind his proper banishment.<br>
Such words he shouts, and calls upon the gods<br>
Who o'er his race preside and Fatherland,<br>
With gracious eye to look upon his prayers.<br>
A well-wrought buckler, newly forged, he bears,<br>
With twofold blazon riveted thereon,<br>
For there a woman leads, with sober mien,<br>
A mail&egrave;d warrior, enchased in gold;<br>
Justice her style, and thus the legend speaks:--<br>
&quot;This man I will restore, and he shall hold<br>
The city and his father's palace homes.&quot;<br>

Alas, our father's curses now bear fruit.<br>
But it beseems not to lament or weep,<br>
Lest lamentations sadder still be born.<br>
For him, too truly Polyneikes named,--<br>
What his device will work we soon shall know;<br>
Whether his braggart words, with madness fraught,<br>
Gold-blazoned on his shield, shall lead him back.<br>
Hath Justice communed with, or claimed him hers,<br>
Guided his deeds and thoughts, this might have been;<br>
But neither when he fled the darksome womb,<br>
Or in his childhood, or in youth's fair prime,<br>
Or when the hair thick gathered on his chin,<br>
Hath Justice communed with, or claimed him hers,<br>
Nor in this outrage on his Fatherland<br>
Deem I she now beside him deigns to stand.<br>
For Justice would in sooth belie her name,<br>
Did she with this all-daring man consort.<br>
In these regards confiding will I go,<br>
Myself will meet him. Who with better right?<br>
Brother to brother, chieftain against chief,<br>
Foeman to foe, I'll stand. Quick, bring my spear,<br>
My greaves, and armor, bulwark against stones.<br>

<h2><a name="AESOP"></a>AESOP</h2>

<h3>(Seventh Century B.C.)</h3>

<h3>BY HARRY THURSTON PECK</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-l.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ike Homer, the greatest of the world's epic poets, Aesop
(Aesopus), the most famous of the world's fabulists, has
been regarded by certain scholars as a wholly mythical
personage. The many improbable stories that are told about him
gain some credence for this theory, which is set forth in detail by
the Italian scholar Vico, who says:--&quot;Aesop, regarded
philosophically, will be found not to have
been an actually existing man, but rather an
abstraction representing a class,&quot;--in other words,
merely a convenient invention of the later Greeks,
who ascribed to him all the fables of which they
could find no certain author.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/214.png" width="45%" alt=""></p>

<p>The only narrative upon which the ancient
writers are in the main agreed represents Aesop
as living in the seventh century before Christ. As
with Homer, so with Aesop, several cities of Asia
Minor claimed the honor of having been his birthplace.
Born a slave and hideously ugly, his keen
wit led his admiring master to set him free; after which he traveled,
visiting Athens, where he is said to have told his fable of
King Log and King Stork to the citizens who were complaining of
the rule of Pisistratus. Still later, having won the favor of King
Croesus of Lydia, he was sent by him to Delphi with a gift of
money for the citizens of that place; but in the course of a dispute
as to its distribution, he was slain by the Delphians, who threw him
over a precipice.</p>

<p>The fables that bore his name seem not to have been committed
by him to writing, but for a long time were handed down from generation
to generation by oral tradition; so that the same fables are
sometimes found quoted in slightly different forms, and we hear of
men learning them in conversation rather than from books. They
were, however, universally popular. Socrates while in prison amused
himself by turning some of them into verse. Aristophanes cites
them in his plays; and he tells how certain suitors once tried to win
favor of a judge by repeating to him some of the amusing stories of
Aesop. The Athenians even erected a statue in his honor. At a
later period, the fables were gathered together and published by the
Athenian statesman and orator, Demetrius Phalereus, in B.C. 320,
and were versified by Babrius (of uncertain date), whose collection is
the only one in Greek of which any substantial portion still survives.
They were often translated by the Romans, and the Latin
version by Phaedrus, the freedman of Augustus Caesar, is still preserved
and still used as a school-book. Forty-two of them are likewise
found in a Latin work by one Avianus, dating from the fifth
century after Christ. During the Middle Ages, when much of the
classical literature had been lost or forgotten, Aesop, who was called
by the mediaevals &quot;Isopet,&quot; was still read in various forms; and in
modern times he has served as a model for a great number of imitations,
of which the most successful are those in French by Lafontaine
and those in English by John Gay.</p>

<p>Whether or not such a person as Aesop ever lived, and whether
or not he actually narrated the fables that are ascribed to him, it is
certain that he did not himself invent them, but merely gave them
currency in Greece; for they can be shown to have existed long
before his time, and in fact to antedate even the beginnings of Hellenic
civilization. With some changes of form they are found in the
oldest literature of the Chinese; similar stories are preserved on the
inscribed Babylonian bricks; and an Egyptian papyrus of about the
year 1200 B.C. gives the fable of 'The Lion and the Mouse' in its
finished form. Other Aesopic apologues are essentially identical with
the Jatakas or Buddhist stories of India, and occur also in the great
Sanskrit story-book, the 'Panchatantra,' which is the very oldest
monument of Hindu literature.</p>

<p>The so-called Aesopic Fables are in fact only a part of the primitive
folk-lore, that springs up in prehistoric times, and passes from
country to country and from race to race by the process of popular
story-telling. They reached Greece, undoubtedly through Egypt and
Persia, and even in their present form they still retain certain Oriental,
or at any rate non-Hellenic elements, such as the introduction
of Eastern animals,--the panther, the peacock, and the ape. They
represent the beginnings of conscious literary effort, when man first
tried to enforce some maxim of practical wisdom and to teach some
useful truth through the fascinating medium of a story. The Fable
embodies a half-unconscious desire to give concrete form to an
abstract principle, and a childish love for the picturesque and striking,
which endows rocks and stones and trees with life, and gives
the power of speech to animals.</p>

<p>That beasts with the attributes of human beings should figure in
these tales involves, from the standpoint of primeval man, only a
very slight divergence from probability. In nothing, perhaps, has
civilization so changed us as in our mental attitude toward animals.
It has fixed a great gulf between us and them--a gulf far greater
than that which divided them from our first ancestors. In the early
ages of the world, when men lived by the chase, and gnawed the
raw flesh of their prey, and slept in lairs amid the jungle, the purely
animal virtues were the only ones they knew and exercised. They
adored courage and strength, and swiftness and endurance. They
respected keenness of scent and vision, and admired cunning. The
possession of these qualities was the very condition of existence, and
they valued them accordingly; but in each one of them they found
their equals, and in fact their superiors, among the brutes. A lion
was stronger than the strongest man. The hare was swifter. The
eagle was more keen-sighted. The fox was more cunning. Hence,
so far from looking down upon the animals from the remotely superior
height that a hundred centuries of civilization have erected for
us, the primitive savage looked up to the beast, studied his ways,
copied him, and went to school to him. The man, then, was not in
those days the lord of creation, and the beast was not his servant;
but they were almost brothers in the subtle sympathy between them,
like that which united Mowgli, the wolf-nursed <i>shikarri</i>, and his hairy
brethren, in that most weirdly wonderful of all Mr. Kipling's
inventions--the one that carries us back, not as his other stories do, to
the India of the cities and the bazaars, of the supercilious tourist and
the sleek Babu, but to the older India of unbroken jungle, darkling
at noonday through its green mist of tangled leaves, and haunted by
memories of the world's long infancy when man and brute crouched
close together on the earthy breast of the great mother.</p>

<p>The Aesopic Fables, then, are the oldest representative that we
have of the literary art of primitive man. The charm that they have
always possessed springs in part from their utter simplicity, their
naivet&eacute;, and their directness; and in part from the fact that their
teachings are the teachings of universal experience, and therefore
appeal irresistibly to the consciousness of every one who hears them,
whether he be savage or scholar, child or sage. They are the literary
antipodes of the last great effort of genius and art working upon
the same material, and found in Mr. Kipling's Jungle Books. The
Fables show only the first stirrings of the literary instinct, the Jungle
Stories bring to bear the full development of the fictive art,--creative
imagination, psychological insight, brilliantly picturesque description,
and the touch of one who is a daring master of vivid language; so
that no better theme can be given to a student of literary history
than the critical comparison of these two allied forms of composition,
representing as they do the two extremes of actual development.</p>

<p>The best general account in English of the origin of the Greek
Fable is that of Rutherford in the introduction to his 'Babrius'
(London, 1883). An excellent special study of the history of the
Aesopic Fables is that by Joseph Jacobs in the first volume of his
'Aesop' (London, 1889). The various ancient accounts of Aesop's life
are collected by Simrock in 'Aesops Leben' (1864). The best scientific
edition of the two hundred and ten fables is that of Halm
(Leipzig, 1887). Good disquisitions on their history during the Middle
Ages are those of Du M&eacute;ril in French (Paris, 1854) and Bruno
in German (Bamberg, 1892). See also the articles in the present
work under the titles 'Babrius,' 'Bidpai,' 'John Gay,' 'Lafontaine,'

to pass that way, and observing what he was about, drew near,
and expressed their admiration at it. &quot;What!&quot; says one of them,
&quot;brother, do you make hanging of a sheep?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; replied the

an idle, good-for-nothing life, spending and squandering away,
upon his own ungodly guts, all the fruits of their labor; and
that, in short, they were resolved, for the future, to strike off his
allowance, and let him shift for himself as well as he could. The
Hands protested they would not lift up a finger to keep him from
starving; and the Mouth wished he might never speak again if
he took in the least bit of nourishment for him as long as he
lived; and, said the Teeth, may we be rotten if ever we chew a
morsel for him for the future. This solemn league and covenant
was kept as long as anything of that kind can be kept, which
was until each of the rebel members pined away to skin and

no doing without the Belly, and that, idle and insignificant as he
seemed, he contributed as much to the maintenance and welfare
of all the other parts as they did to his.

extremity of the weather. He took compassion on him,
and kindly invited him home to a warm, comfortable cave he had
in the hollow of a rock. As soon as they had entered and sat
down, notwithstanding there was a good fire in the place, the
chilly Traveler could not forbear blowing his fingers' ends. Upon
the Satyr's asking why he did so, he answered, that he did it to
warm his hands. The honest sylvan having seen little of the
world, admired a man who was master of so valuable a quality as
that of blowing heat, and therefore was resolved to entertain him
in the best manner he could. He spread the table before him
with dried fruits of several sorts; and produced a remnant of
cold wine, which as the rigor of the season made very proper, he
mulled with some warm spices, infused over the fire, and presented
to his shivering guest. But this the Traveler thought fit
to blow likewise; and upon the Satyr's demanding a reason why
he blowed again, he replied, to cool his dish. This second answer
provoked the Satyr's indignation as much as the first had
kindled his surprise: so, taking the man by the shoulder, he
thrust him out of doors, saying he would have nothing to do
with a wretch who had so vile a quality as to blow hot and cold
with the same mouth.

the division was made, and the parts were set out, his Majesty,
advancing forward some steps and pointing to one of the shares,
was pleased to declare himself after the following manner:--
&quot;This I seize and take possession of as my right, which devolves
to me, as I am descended by a true, lineal, hereditary succession
from the royal family of Lion. That [pointing to the second] I
claim by, I think, no unreasonable demand; considering that all the
engagements you have with the enemy turn chiefly upon my
courage and conduct, and you very well know that wars are too
expensive to be carried on without proper supplies. Then [nodding
his head toward the third] that I shall take by virtue of my
prerogative; to which, I make no question but so dutiful and
loyal a people will pay all the deference and regard that I can
desire. Now, as for the remaining part, the necessity of our

his tail, and leaping up into his Master's lap: he was resolved to
imitate the same, and see whether such a behavior would not
procure him the same favors. Accordingly, the Master was no
sooner come home from walking about his fields and gardens,
and was seated in his easy-chair, but the Ass, who observed him,
came gamboling and braying towards him, in a very awkward
manner. The Master could not help laughing aloud at the odd
sight. But his jest was soon turned into earnest, when he felt
the rough salute of the Ass's fore-feet, who, raising himself upon
his hinder legs, pawed against his breast with a most loving air,
and would fain have jumped into his lap. The good man, terrified
at this outrageous behavior, and unable to endure the weight
of so heavy a beast, cried out; upon which, one of his servants
running in with a good stick, and laying on heartily upon the
bones of the poor Ass, soon convinced him that every one who
desires it is not qualified to be a favorite.

<h3><a name="THE_COUNTRY_MOUSE_AND_THE_CITY_MOUSE"></a>THE COUNTRY MOUSE AND THE CITY MOUSE</h3>

<blockquote>An honest, plain, sensible Country Mouse is said to have
entertained at his hole one day a fine Mouse of the Town.
Having formerly been playfellows together, they were old
acquaintances, which served as an apology for the visit. However,
as master of the house, he thought himself obliged to do
the honors of it in all respects, and to make as great a stranger
of his guest as he possibly could. In order to do this he set
before him a reserve of delicate gray pease and bacon, a dish of
fine oatmeal, some parings of new cheese, and, to crown all with
a dessert, a remnant of a charming mellow apple. In good manners,
he forbore to eat any himself, lest the stranger should not
have enough; but that he might seem to bear the other company,
sat and nibbled a piece of a wheaten straw very busily. At last,
says the spark of the town:--&quot;Old crony, give me leave to be a
little free with you: how can you bear to live in this nasty,
dirty, melancholy hole here, with nothing but woods, and meadows,
and mountains, and rivulets about you? Do not you prefer
the conversation of the world to the chirping of birds, and
the splendor of a court to the rude aspect of an uncultivated
desert? Come, take my word for it, you will find it a change
for the better. Never stand considering, but away this moment.
Remember, we are not immortal, and therefore have no time to
lose. Make sure of to-day, and spend it as agreeably as you can:
you know not what may happen to-morrow.&quot; In short, these
and such like arguments prevailed, and his Country Acquaintance
was resolved to go to town that night. So they both set out
upon their journey together, proposing to sneak in after the close
of the evening. They did so; and about midnight made their
entry into a certain great house, where there had been an extraordinary
entertainment the day before, and several tit-bits, which
some of the servants had purloined, were hid under the seat of
a window. The Country Guest was immediately placed in the
midst of a rich Persian carpet: and now it was the Courtier's
turn to entertain; who indeed acquitted himself in that capacity
with the utmost readiness and address, changing the courses as
elegantly, and tasting everything first as judiciously, as any
clerk of the kitchen. The other sat and enjoyed himself like a
delighted epicure, tickled to the last degree with this new turn
of his affairs; when on a sudden, a noise of somebody opening
the door made them start from their seats, and scuttle in confusion
about the dining-room. Our Country Friend, in particular,
was ready to die with fear at the barking of a huge mastiff or
two, which opened their throats just about the same time, and
made the whole house echo. At last, recovering himself:--&quot;Well,&quot;
says he, &quot;if this be your town-life, much good may you
do with it: give me my poor, quiet hole again, with my homely
but comfortable gray pease.&quot;

night, to meet with a jolly, plump, well-fed Mastiff; and
after the first compliments were passed, says the Wolf:--&quot;You
look extremely well. I protest, I think I never saw a
more graceful, comely person; but how comes it about, I beseech
you, that you should live so much better than I? I may say,
without vanity, that I venture fifty times more than you do;
and yet I am almost ready to perish with hunger.&quot; The Dog
answered very bluntly, &quot;Why, you may live as well, if you will
do the same for it that I do.&quot;--&quot;Indeed? what is that?&quot; says
he.--&quot;Why,&quot; says the Dog, &quot;only to guard the house a-nights,
and keep it from thieves.&quot;--&quot;With all my heart,&quot; replies the
Wolf, &quot;for at present I have but a sorry time of it; and I
think to change my hard lodging in the woods, where I endure
rain, frost, and snow, for a warm roof over my head, and a
bellyful of good victuals, will be no bad bargain.&quot;--&quot;True,&quot;
says the Dog; &quot;therefore you have nothing more to do but to
follow me.&quot; Now, as they were jogging on together, the Wolf
spied a crease in the Dog's neck, and having a strange curiosity,
could not forbear asking him what it meant. &quot;Pooh! nothing,&quot;
says the Dog.--&quot;Nay, but pray--&quot; says the Wolf.--&quot;Why,&quot;
says the Dog, &quot;if you must know, I am tied up in the daytime,
because I am a little fierce, for fear I should bite people, and
am only let loose a-nights. But this is done with design to make
me sleep a-days, more than anything else, and that I may watch
the better in the night-time; for as soon as ever the twilight
appears, out I am turned, and may go where I please. Then
my master brings me plates of bones from the table with his
own hands, and whatever scraps are left by any of the family,
all fall to my share; for you must know I am a favorite with
everybody. So you see how you are to live. Come, come along:
what is the matter with you?&quot;--&quot;No,&quot; replied the Wolf, &quot;I
beg your pardon: keep your happiness all to yourself. Liberty
is the word with me; and I would not be a king upon the terms
you mention.&quot;</blockquote>

<h3>(1807-1873)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>t first, when a mere boy, twelve years of age,&quot; writes the
great Swiss naturalist, &quot;I did what most beginners do. I
picked up whatever I could lay my hands on, and tried, by
such books and authorities as I had at my command, to find the
names of these objects. My highest ambition at that time, was to
be able to designate the plants and animals of my native country
correctly by a Latin name, and to extend gradually a similar knowledge
in its application to the productions of other countries. This
seemed to me, in those days, the legitimate aim and proper work of
a naturalist. I still possess manuscript volumes in which I entered
the names of all the animals and plants with which I became acquainted,
and I well remember that I then ardently hoped to acquire
the same superficial familiarity with the whole creation. I did not
then know how much more important it is to the naturalist to understand
the structure of a few animals than to command the whole field
of scientific nomenclature. Since I have become a teacher, and have
watched the progress of students, I have seen that they all begin in
the same way. But how many have grown old in the pursuit, without
ever rising to any higher conception of the study of nature,
spending their life in the determination of species, and in extending
scientific terminology! Long before I went to the university, and
before I began to study natural history under the guidance of men
who were masters in the science during the early part of this century,
I perceived that though nomenclature and classification, as then
understood, formed an important part of the study, being, in fact, its
technical language, the study of living beings in their natural element
was of infinitely greater value. At that age--namely, about
fifteen--I spent most of the time I could spare from classical and
mathematical studies in hunting the neighboring woods and meadows
for birds, insects, and land and fresh-water shells. My room became
a little menagerie, while the stone basin under the fountain in our
yard was my reservoir for all the fishes I could catch. Indeed, collecting,
fishing, and raising caterpillars, from which I reared fresh,
beautiful butterflies, were then my chief pastimes. What I know
of the habits of the fresh-water fishes of Central Europe I mostly
learned at that time; and I may add, that when afterward I obtained
access to a large library and could consult the works of Bloch and
Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de, the only extensive works on fishes then in existence. I
wondered that they contained so little about their habits, natural
attitudes, and mode of action, with which I was so familiar.&quot;</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/225.jpg" width="45%" alt="">
</p><br>

<p>It is this way of looking at things that gives to Agassiz's writings
their literary and popular interest. He was born in Mortier, Canton
Fribourg, May 28th, 1807, the son of a clergyman, who sent his gifted
son to the Universities of Z&uuml;rich, Heidelberg, and Munich, where he
acquired reputation for his brilliant powers, and entered into the
enthusiastic, intellectual, and merry student-life, taking his place in
the formal duels, and becoming known as a champion fencer. Agassiz
was an influence in every centre that he touched; and in Munich,
his room and his laboratory, thick with clouds of smoke from the
long-stemmed German pipes, was a gathering-place for the young
scientific aspirants, who affectionately called it &quot;The Little Academy.&quot;
At the age of twenty-two, he had published his 'Fishes of Brazil,' a
folio that brought him into immediate recognition. Cuvier, the greatest
ichthyologist of his time, to whom the first volume was dedicated,
received him as a pupil, and gave to him all the material that he
had been collecting during fifteen years for a contemplated work on
Fossil Fishes. In Paris Agassiz also won the friendship of Humboldt,
who, learning that he stood in need of money, presented him with so
generous a sum as to enable the ambitious young naturalist to work
with a free and buoyant spirit.</p>

<p>His practical career began in 1832, when he was installed at Neufch&acirc;tel,
from which point he easily studied the Alps. Two years later,
after the 'Poissons fossiles' (Fossil Fishes) appeared, he visited England
to lecture. Then returning to his picturesque home, he applied
himself to original investigation, and through his lectures and
publications won honors and degrees. His daring opinions, however,
sometimes provoked ardent discussion and angry comment.</p>

<p>Agassiz's passion for investigation frequently led him into dangers
that imperiled both life and limb. In the summer of 1841, for example,
he was lowered into a deep crevasse bristling with huge stalactites
of ice, to reach the heart of a glacier moving at the rate of
forty feet a day. While he was observing the blue bands on the
glittering ice, he suddenly touched a well of water, and only after
great difficulty made his companions understand his signal for rescue.
These Alpine experiences are well described by Mrs. Elizabeth Gary
Agassiz, and also by Edouard Desors in his 'S&eacute;jours dans les Glaciers'
(Sojourn among the Glaciers: Neufch&acirc;tel, 1844). Interesting
particulars of these glacial studies ('&Eacute;tudes des Glaciers') were soon
issued, and Agassiz received many gifts from lovers of science,
among whom was numbered the King of Prussia. His zo&ouml;logical and
geological investigations were continued, and important works on
'Fossil Mollusks,' 'Tertiary Shells,' and 'Living and Fossil Echinoderms'
date from this period.</p>

<p>He had long desired to visit America, when he realized this wish
in 1846 by an arrangement with the Lowell Institute of Boston,
where he gave a series of lectures, afterwards repeated in various
cities. So attractive did he find the fauna and flora of America, and
so vast a field did he perceive here for his individual studies and
instruction, that he returned the following year. In 1848 the Prussian
government, which had borne the expenses of his scientific mission,--a
cruise along our Atlantic coast to study its marine life,--released
him from further obligation that he might accept the chair of geology
in the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University. His
cruises, his explorations, and his methods, combined with his attractive
personality, gave him unique power as a teacher; and many of
his biographers think that of all his gifts, the ability to instruct was
the most conspicuous. He needed no text-books, for he went directly
to Nature, and did not believe in those technical, dry-as-dust terms
which lead to nothing and which are swept away by the next generation.
Many noted American men of science remember the awakening
influence of his laboratories in Charleston and Cambridge, his
museum at Harvard, and his summer school at Penikese Island in
Buzzard's Bay, Massachusetts, where natural history was studied
under ideal conditions. It was here that he said to his class:--&quot;A
laboratory of natural history is a sanctuary where nothing profane
should be tolerated.&quot; Whittier has left a poem called &quot;The Prayer
of Agassiz,&quot; describing</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">&quot;The isle of Penikese</p>
<p>Ranged about by sapphire seas.&quot;</p>
</div></div>

<p>Just as he was realizing two of his ambitions, the establishment
of a great museum and a practical school of zo&ouml;logy, he died, December
14th, 1873, at his home in Cambridge, and was buried at Mount
Auburn beneath pine-trees sent from Switzerland, while a bowlder
from the glacier of the Aar was selected to mark his resting-place.</p>

<p>Agassiz was greatly beloved by his pupils and associates, and was
identified with the brilliant group--Emerson, Longfellow, Holmes, and
Lowell,--each of whom has written of him. Lowell considered his
'Elegy on Agassiz,' written in Florence in 1874, among his best
verses; Longfellow wrote a poem for 'The Fiftieth Birthday of
Agassiz,' and Holmes 'A Farewell to Agassiz' on his departure for
the Andes, whose affectionate and humorous strain thus closes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Till their glorious raid is o'er,<br>
And they touch our ransomed shore!<br>
Then the welcome of a nation,<br>
With its shout of exultation,<br>
Shall awake the dumb creation,<br>
And the shapes of buried aeons<br>
Join the living creatures' paeans,<br>
While the mighty megalosaurus<br>
Leads the palaeozoic chorus,--<br>
God bless the great Professor,<br>
And the land its proud possessor,--<br>
Bless them now and evermore!&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Numerous biographies and monographs of Agassiz exist in many
languages, a complete list of which is given in the last published
'Life of Agassiz,' by Jules Marcou (New York and London, 1896),
and also in the 'Life of Agassiz,' by Charles F. Holder (New York,
1893). Complete lists of Agassiz's works are also given in these
biographies, and these titles show how versatile was his taste and how
deep and wide his research. His principal contributions to science
are in French and Latin, but his most popular books appeared in
English. These include 'The Structure of Animal Life,' 'Methods of
Study,' 'Geological Sketches,' and 'Journey in Brazil,' the latter
written with Mrs. Agassiz. His 'Contributions to the Natural History
of the United States,' planned to be in ten large books, only reached
four volumes.</p>

<p>In his 'Researches concerning Fossil Fishes,' Agassiz expressed
the views that made him a lifelong opponent of the Darwinian
theories, although he was a warm friend of Darwin. Considering
the demands upon his time as teacher, lecturer, and investigator,
the excellence not less than the amount of the great naturalist's
work is remarkable, and won such admiration that he was made a
member of nearly every scientific society in the world. One of his
favorite pastimes was deep-sea dredging, which embraced the excitement
of finding strange specimens and studying their singular habits.</p>

<p>Of his love and gift for instructing, Mrs. Agassiz says in her
'Life' (Boston, 1885):--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Teaching was a passion with him, and his power over his pupils might
be measured by his own enthusiasm. He was, intellectually as well as socially,
a democrat in the best sense. He delighted to scatter broadcast the highest
results of thought and research, and to adapt them even to the youngest and
most uninformed minds. In his later American travels he would talk of glacial
phenomena to the driver of a country stage-coach among the mountains,
or to some workman splitting rock at the roadside, with as much earnestness
as if he had been discussing problems with a brother geologist; he would
take the common fisherman into his scientific confidence, telling him the intimate
secrets of fish-culture or fish-embryology, till the man in his turn grew
enthusiastic and began to pour out information from the stores of his own
rough and untaught habits of observation. Agassiz's general faith in the
susceptibility of the popular intelligence, however untaught, to the highest
truths of nature, was contagious, and he created or developed that in which
he believed.&quot;

<p>The following citations exhibit his powers of observation, and that
happy method of stating scientific facts which interests the specialist
and general reader alike.</p>

<p>With what interest do we look upon any relic of early
human history! The monument that tells of a civilization
whose hieroglyphic records we cannot even decipher,
the slightest trace of a nation that vanished and left no sign of
its life except the rough tools and utensils buried in the old site
of its towns or villages, arouses our imagination and excites our
curiosity. Men gaze with awe at the inscription on an ancient
Egyptian or Assyrian stone; they hold with reverential touch the
yellow parchment-roll whose dim, defaced characters record the
meagre learning of a buried nationality; and the announcement
that for centuries the tropical forests of Central America have
hidden within their tangled growth the ruined homes and temples
of a past race, stirs the civilized world with a strange, deep
wonder.</p>

<p>To me it seems, that to look on the first land that was ever
lifted above the wasted waters, to follow the shore where the
earliest animals and plants were created when the thought of God
first expressed itself in organic forms, to hold in one's hand a bit
of stone from an old sea-beach, hardened into rock thousands of
centuries ago, and studded with the beings that once crept upon
its surface or were stranded there by some retreating wave, is
even of deeper interest to men than the relics of their own race,
for these things tell more directly of the thoughts and creative
acts of God.</p>

<p>The statement that different sets of animals and plants have
characterized the successive epochs is often understood as indicating
a difference of another kind than that which distinguishes
animals now living in different parts of the world. This is a mistake.
They are so-called representative types all over the globe,
united to each other by structural relations and separated by
specific differences of the same kind as those that unite and separate
animals of different geological periods. Take, for instance,
mud-flats or sandy shores in the same latitudes of Europe and
America: we find living on each, animals of the same structural
character and of the same general appearance, but with certain
specific differences, as of color, size, external appendages, etc.
They represent each other on the two continents. The American
wolves, foxes, bears, rabbits, are not the same as the European.
but those of one continent are as true to their respective types as
those of the other; under a somewhat different aspect they represent
the same groups of animals. In certain latitudes, or under
conditions of nearer proximity, these differences may be less
marked. It is well known that there is a great monotony of
type, not only among animals and plants but in the human races
also, throughout the Arctic regions; and some animals characteristic
of the high North reappear under such identical forms in
the neighborhood of the snow-fields in lofty mountains, that to
trace the difference between the ptarmigans, rabbits, and other
gnawing animals of the Alps, for instance, and those of the
Arctics, is among the most difficult problems of modern science.</p>

<p>And so is it also with the animated world of past ages: in
similar deposits of sand, mud, or lime, in adjoining regions of
the same geological age, identical remains of animals and plants
may be found; while at greater distances, but under similar circumstances,
representative species may occur. In very remote
regions, however, whether the circumstances be similar or dissimilar,
the general aspect of the organic world differs greatly,
remoteness in space being thus in some measure an indication of
the degree of affinity between different faunae. In deposits of
different geological periods immediately following each other, we
sometimes find remains of animals and plants so closely allied to
those of earlier or later periods that at first sight the specific differences
are hardly discernible. The difficulty of solving these
questions, and of appreciating correctly the differences and similarities
between such closely allied organisms, explains the antagonistic
views of many naturalists respecting the range of existence
of animals, during longer or shorter geological periods; and the
superficial way in which discussions concerning the transition of
species are carried on, is mainly owing to an ignorance of the
conditions above alluded to. My own personal observation and
experience in these matters have led me to the conviction that
every geological period has had its own representatives, and that
no single species has been repeated in successive ages.</p>

<p>The laws regulating the geographical distribution of animals,
and their combination into distinct zo&ouml;logical provinces called faunae,
with definite limits, are very imperfectly understood as yet;
but so closely are all things linked together from the beginning
till to-day, that I am convinced we shall never find the clew
to their meaning till we carry on our investigations in the
past and the present simultaneously. The same principle according
to which animal and vegetable life is distributed over the
surface of the earth now, prevailed in the earliest geological
periods. The geological deposits of all times have had their
characteristic faunae under various zones, their zo&ouml;logical provinces
presenting special combinations of animal and vegetable
life over certain regions, and their representative types reproducing
in different countries, but under similar latitudes, the
same groups with specific differences.</p>

<p>Of course, the nearer we approach the beginning of organic
life, the less marked do we find the differences to be; and for a
very obvious reason. The inequalities of the earth's surface, her
mountain-barriers protecting whole continents from the Arctic
winds, her open plains exposing others to the full force of the
polar blasts, her snug valleys and her lofty heights, her tablelands
and rolling prairies, her river-systems and her dry deserts,
her cold ocean-currents pouring down from the high North on
some of her shores, while warm ones from tropical seas carry
their softer influence to others,--in short, all the contrasts in the
external configuration of the globe, with the physical conditions
attendant upon them, are naturally accompanied by a corresponding
variety in animal and vegetable life.</p>

<p>But in the Silurian age, when there were no elevations higher
than the Canadian hills, when water covered the face of the
earth with the exception of a few isolated portions lifted above
the almost universal ocean, how monotonous must have been the
conditions of life! And what should we expect to find on those
first shores? If we are walking on a sea-beach to-day, we do not
look for animals that haunt the forests or roam over the open
plains, or for those that live in sheltered valleys or in inland
regions or on mountain-heights. We look for Shells, for Mussels
and Barnacles, for Crabs, for Shrimps, for Marine Worms, for
Star-Fishes and Sea-Urchins, and we may find here and there a
fish stranded on the sand or strangled in the sea-weed. Let us
remember, then, that in the Silurian period the world, so far as
it was raised above the ocean, was a beach; and let us seek
there for such creatures as God has made to live on seashores,
and not belittle the Creative work, or say that He first scattered
the seeds of life in meagre or stinted measure, because we do
not find air-breathing animals when there was no fitting atmosphere
to feed their lungs, insects with no terrestrial plants to
live upon, reptiles without marshes, birds without trees, cattle
without grass,--all things, in short, without the essential conditions
for their existence....</p>

<p>I have spoken of the Silurian beach as if there were but one,
not only because I wished to limit my sketch, and to attempt
at least to give it the vividness of a special locality, but also
because a single such shore will give us as good an idea of the
characteristic fauna of the time as if we drew our material from
a wider range. There are, however, a great number of parallel
ridges belonging to the Silurian and Devonian periods, running
from east to west, not only through the State of New York, but
far beyond, through the States of Michigan and Wisconsin into
Minnesota; one may follow nine or ten such successive shores in
unbroken lines, from the neighborhood of Lake Champlain to the
Far West. They have all the irregularities of modern seashores,
running up to form little bays here, and jutting out in promontories
there....</p>

<p>Although the early geological periods are more legible in
North America, because they are exposed over such extensive
tracts of land, yet they have been studied in many other parts
of the globe. In Norway, in Germany, in France, in Russia, in
Siberia, in Kamchatka, in parts of South America,--in short,
wherever the civilization of the white race has extended, Silurian
deposits have been observed, and everywhere they bear the same
testimony to a profuse and varied creation. The earth was
teeming then with life as now; and in whatever corner of its
surface the geologist finds the old strata, they hold a dead fauna
as numerous as that which lives and moves above it. Nor do we
find that there was any gradual increase or decrease of any
organic forms at the beginning and close of the successive
periods. On the contrary, the opening scenes of every chapter
in the world's history have been crowded with life, and its last
leaves as full and varied as its first.</p>

<h3><a name="VOICES"></a>VOICES</h3>

<center>From 'Methods of Study in Natural History'</center>
<br>

<p>There is a chapter in the Natural History of animals that has
hardly been touched upon as yet, and that will be especially
interesting with reference to families. The voices of animals
have a family character not to be mistaken. All the
<i>Canidae</i> bark and howl!--the fox, the wolf, the dog, have the
same kind of utterance, though on a somewhat different pitch.
All the bears growl, from the white bear of the Arctic snows to
the small black bear of the Andes. All the cats meow, from our
quiet fireside companion to the lions and tigers and panthers of
the forests and jungle. This last may seem a strange assertion;
but to any one who has listened critically to their sounds and
analyzed their voices, the roar of the lion is but a gigantic meow,
bearing about the same proportion to that of a cat as its stately
and majestic form does to the smaller, softer, more peaceful
aspect of the cat. Yet notwithstanding the difference in their
size, who can look at the lion, whether in his more sleepy mood,
as he lies curled up in the corner of his cage, or in his fiercer
moments of hunger or of rage, without being reminded of a
cat? And this is not merely the resemblance of one carnivorous
animal to another; for no one was ever reminded of a dog or
wolf by a lion.</p>

<p>Again, all the horses and donkeys neigh; for the bray of a
donkey is only a harsher neigh, pitched on a different key, it is
true, but a sound of the same character--as the donkey himself
is but a clumsy and dwarfish horse. All the cows low, from the
buffalo roaming the prairie, the musk-ox of the Arctic ice-fields,
or the yak of Asia, to the cattle feeding in our pastures.</p>

<p>Among the birds, this similarity of voice in families is still
more marked. We need only recall the harsh and noisy parrots,
so similar in their peculiar utterance. Or, take as an example
the web-footed family: Do not all the geese and the innumerable
host of ducks quack? Does not every member of the crow family
caw, whether it be the jackdaw, the jay, or the magpie, the
rook in some green rookery of the Old World, or the crow of
our woods, with its long, melancholy caw that seems to make the
silence and solitude deeper? Compare all the sweet warblers of
the songster family--the nightingales, the thrushes, the mocking-birds,
the robins; they differ in the greater or less perfection of
their note, but the same kind of voice runs through the whole
group.</p>

<p>These affinities of the vocal systems among the animals form
a subject well worthy of the deepest study, not only as another
character by which to classify the animal kingdom correctly, but
as bearing indirectly also on the question of the origin of animals.
Can we suppose that characteristics like these have been
communicated from one animal to another? When we find that
all the members of one zo&ouml;logical family, however widely scattered
over the surface of the earth, inhabiting different continents
and even different hemispheres, speak with one voice, must we
not believe that they have originated in the places where they
now occur, with all their distinctive peculiarities? Who taught
the American thrush to sing like his European relative? He
surely did not learn it from his cousin over the waters. Those
who would have us believe that all animals originated from common
centres and single pairs, and have been thence distributed
over the world, will find it difficult to explain the tenacity of
such characters, and their recurrence and repetition under circumstances
that seem to preclude the possibility of any communication,
on any other supposition than that of their creation in the different
regions where they are now found. We have much yet to
learn, from investigations of this kind, with reference not only to
families among animals, but to nationalities among men also....</p>

<p>The similarity of motion in families is another subject well
worth the consideration of the naturalist: the soaring of the birds
of prey,--the heavy flapping of the wings in the gallinaceous
birds,--the floating of the swallows, with their short cuts and angular
turns,--the hopping of the sparrows,--the deliberate walk of
the hens and the strut of the cocks,--the waddle of the ducks and
geese,--the slow, heavy creeping of the land-turtle,--the graceful
flight of the sea-turtle under the water,--the leaping and swimming
of the frog,--the swift run of the lizard, like a flash of
green or red light in the sunshine,--the lateral undulation of the
serpent,--the dart of the pickerel,--the leap of the trout,--the
rush of the hawk-moth through the air,--the fluttering flight of
the butterfly,--the quivering poise of the humming-bird,--the
arrow-like shooting of the squid through the water,--the slow
crawling of the snail on the land,--the sideway movement of
the sand-crab,--the backward walk of the crawfish,--the almost
imperceptible gliding of the sea-anemone over the rock,--the
graceful, rapid motion of the <i>Pleurobrachia</i>, with its endless
change of curve and spiral. In short, every family of animals
has its characteristic action and its peculiar voice; and yet so little
is this endless variety of rhythm and cadence both of motion
and sound in the organic world understood, that we lack words to
express one-half its richness and beauty.</p>
<br><br>


<h3><a name="FORMATION_OF_CORAL_REEFS"></a>FORMATION OF CORAL REEFS</h3>

<center>From 'Methods of Study in Natural History'</center>
<br>

<p>For a long time it was supposed that the reef-builders inhabited
very deep waters; for they were sometimes brought up upon
sounding-lines from a depth of many hundreds or even
thousands of feet, and it was taken for granted that they must
have had their home where they were found: but the facts
recently ascertained respecting the subsidence of ocean-bottoms
have shown that the foundation of a coral-wall may have sunk
far below the place where it was laid. And it is now proved,
beyond a doubt, that no reef-building coral can thrive at a depth
of more than fifteen fathoms, though corals of other kinds occur
far lower, and that the dead reef-corals, sometimes brought to
the surface from much greater depths, are only broken fragments
of some reef that has subsided with the bottom on which it was
growing. But though fifteen fathoms is the maximum depth at
which any reef-builder can prosper, there are many which will
not sustain even that degree of pressure; and this fact has, as
we shall see, an important influence on the structure of the reef.</p>

<p>Imagine now a sloping shore on some tropical coast descending
gradually below the surface of the sea. Upon that slope, at a
depth of from ten to twelve or fifteen fathoms, and two or three
or more miles from the mainland, according to the shelving of
the shore, we will suppose that one of those little coral animals,
to whom a home in such deep waters is congenial, has established
itself. How it happens that such a being, which we know is
immovably attached to the ground, and forms the foundation of
a solid wall, was ever able to swim freely about in the water till
it found a suitable resting-place, I shall explain hereafter, when
I say something of the mode of reproduction of these animals.
Accept, for the moment, my unsustained assertion, and plant our
little coral on this sloping shore, some twelve or fifteen fathoms
below the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>The internal structure of such a coral corresponds to that of
the sea-anemone. The body is divided by vertical partitions from
top to bottom, leaving open chambers between; while in the
centre hangs the digestive cavity, connected by an opening in the
bottom with all these chambers. At the top is an aperture serving
as a mouth, surrounded by a wreath of hollow tentacles, each
one of which connects at its base with one of the chambers, so
that all parts of the animal communicate freely with each other.
But though the structure of the coral is identical in all its parts
with the sea-anemone, it nevertheless presents one important
difference. The body of the sea-anemone is soft, while that of
the coral is hard.</p>

<p>It is well known that all animals and plants have the power
of appropriating to themselves and assimilating the materials they
need, each selecting from the surrounding elements whatever
contributes to its well-being. Now, corals possess in an extraordinary
degree, the power of assimilating to themselves the lime
contained in the salt water around them; and as soon as our little
coral is established on a firm foundation, a lime deposit begins to
form in all the walls of its body, so that its base, its partitions,
and its outer wall, which in the sea-anemone remain always soft,
become perfectly solid in the polyp coral, and form a frame as
hard as bone.</p>

<p>It may naturally be asked where the lime comes from in the
sea which the corals absorb in such quantities. As far as the
living corals are concerned the answer is easy, for an immense
deal of lime is brought down to the ocean by rivers that wear
away the lime deposits through which they pass. The Mississippi,
whose course lies through extensive lime regions, brings down
yearly lime enough to supply all the animals living in the Gulf of
Mexico. But behind this lies a question, not so easily settled, as
to the origin of the extensive deposits of limestone found at the
very beginning of life upon earth. This problem brings us to the
threshold of astronomy; for the base of limestone is metallic in
character, susceptible therefore of fusion, and may have formed a
part of the materials of our earth, even in an incandescent state,
when the worlds were forming. But though this investigation as
to the origin of lime does not belong either to the naturalist or the
geologist, its suggestion reminds us that the time has come when
all the sciences and their results are so intimately connected that
no one can be carried on independently of the others. Since the
study of the rocks has revealed a crowded life whose records are
hoarded within them, the work of the geologist and the naturalist
has become one and the same; and at that border-land where the
first crust of the earth was condensed out of the igneous mass of
materials which formed its earliest condition, their investigation
mingles with that of the astronomer, and we cannot trace the
limestone in a little coral without going back to the creation of
our solar system, when the worlds that compose it were thrown
off from a central mass in a gaseous condition.</p>

<p>When the coral has become in this way permeated with lime,
all parts of the body are rigid, with the exception of the upper
margin, the stomach, and the tentacles. The tentacles are soft
and waving, projected or drawn in at will; they retain their flexible
character through life, and decompose when the animal dies.
For this reason the dried specimens of corals preserved in
museums do not give us the least idea of the living corals, in
which every one of the millions of beings composing such a community
is crowned by a waving wreath of white or green or
rose-colored tentacles.</p>

<p>As soon as the little coral is fairly established and solidly
attached to the ground, it begins to bud. This may take place
in a variety of ways, dividing at the top or budding from the
base or from the sides, till the primitive animal is surrounded by
a number of individuals like itself, of which it forms the nucleus,
and which now begin to bud in their turn, each one surrounding
itself with a numerous progeny, all remaining, however, attached
to the parent. Such a community increases till its individuals are
numbered by millions, and I have myself counted no less than
fourteen millions of individuals in a coral mass of Porites measuring
not more than twelve feet in diameter. The so-called coral
heads, which make the foundation of a coral wall, and seem by
their massive character and regular form especially adapted to
give a strong, solid base to the whole structure, are known in
our classification as the <i>Astraeans</i>, so named on account of the
little [star-shaped] pits crowded upon their surface, each one of
which marks the place of a single more or less isolated individual
in such a community.</p>

<h2><a name="AGATHIAS"></a>AGATHIAS</h2>

<h3>(536-581)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>gathas tells us, in his 'Prooemium,' that he was born at
Myrina, Asia Minor, that his father's name was Memnonius,
and his own profession the law of the Romans and practice
in courts of justice. He was born about A.D. 536, and was educated
at Alexandria. In Constantinople he studied and practiced his profession,
and won his surname of &quot;Scholasticus,&quot; a title then given to a
lawyer. He died, it is believed, at the age of forty-four or forty-five.
He was a Christian, as he testifies in his epigrams. In the sketch
of his life prefixed to his works, Niebuhr collates the friendships he
himself mentions, with his fellow-poet Paulus Silentiarius, with Theodorus
the decemvir, and Macedonius the ex-consul. To these men
he dedicated some of his writings.</p>

<p>Of his works, he says in his 'Prooemium' that he wrote in his
youth the 'Daphniaca,' a volume of short poems in hexameters, set
off with love-tales. His 'Anthology,' or 'Cyclus,' was a collection of
poems of early writers, and also compositions of his friend Paulus
Silentiarius and others of his time. A number of his epigrams, preserved
because they were written before or after his publication of
the 'Cyclus,' have come down to us and are contained in the 'Anthologia
Graeca.' His principal work is his 'Historia,' which is an
account of the conquest of Italy by Narses, of the first war between
the Greeks and Franks, of the great earthquakes and plagues, of the
war between the Greeks and Persians, and the deeds of Belisarius in
his contest with the Huns,--of all that was happening in the world
Agathias knew between 553 and 558 A.D., while he was a young
man. He tells, for instance, of the rebuilding of the great Church of
St. Sophia by Justinian, and he adds:--&quot;If any one who happens to
live in some place remote from the city wishes to get a clear notion
of every part, as though he were there, let him read what Paulus
[Silentiarius] has composed in hexameter verse.&quot;</p>

<p>The history of Agathias is valuable as a chronicle. It shows that
the writer had little knowledge of geography, and was not enough of
a philosopher to look behind events and trace the causes from which
they proceeded. He is merely a simple and honest writer, and his
history is a business-like entry of facts. He dwells upon himself and
his wishes with a minuteness that might seem self-conscious, but is
really <i>naif</i>; and goes so far in his outspokenness as to say that if
for the sake of a livelihood he took up another profession, his taste
would have led him to devote himself to the Muses and Graces.</p>

<p>He wrote in the Ionic dialect of his time. The best edition of his
'Historia' is that of Niebuhr (1828). Those of his epigrams preserved
in the Greek anthology have not infrequently been turned
into English; the happiest translation of all is that of Dryden, in his
'Life of Plutarch.'</p>
<br><br>

<h2><a name="GRACE_AGUILAR"></a>GRACE AGUILAR</h2>

<h3>(1816-1847)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-f.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ifty years ago a Jewish writer of English fiction was a new
and interesting figure in English literature. Disraeli, indeed,
had flashed into the literary world with 'Coningsby,' that
eloquent vindication of the Jewish race. His grandiose 'Tancred'
had revealed to an astonished public the strange life of the Desert,
of the mysterious vastness whence swept forth the tribes who became
the Moors of Spain and the Jews of Palestine. Disraeli, however,
stood in no category, and established no precedent. But when Miss
Aguilar's stories began to appear, they were
eagerly welcomed by a public with whom
she had already won reputation and favor
as the defender and interpreter of her faith.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/240.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>The youngest child of a rich and refined
household, Grace Aguilar was born in 1816
at Hackney, near London, of that historic
strain of Spanish-Jewish blood which for
generations had produced not only beauty
and artistic sensibility, but intellect. Her
ancestors were refugees from persecution,
and in her burned that ardor of faith which
persecution kindles. Fragile and sensitive,
she was educated at home, by her cultivated
father and mother, under whose solicitous training she developed an
alarming precocity. At the age of twelve she had written a heroic
drama on her favorite hero, Gustavus Vasa. At fourteen she had
published a volume of poems. At twenty-four she accomplished her
chief work on the Jewish religion, 'The Spirit of Judaism,' a book
republished in America with preface and notes by a well-known
rabbi, Dr. Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia. Although the orthodox priest
found much in the book to criticize, he was forced to commend its
ability.--It insists on the importance of the spiritual and moral
aspects of the faith delivered to Abraham, and deprecates a superstitious
reverence for the mere letter of the law. It presents Judaism
as a religion of love, and the Old Testament as the inspiration of the
teachings of Jesus. Written more than half a century ago, the book
is widely read to-day by students of the Jewish religion.</p>

<p>Four years later Miss Aguilar published 'The Jewish Faith: Its
Spiritual Consolation, Moral Guidance, and Immortal Hope,' and 'The
Women of Israel,' a series of essays on Biblical history, which was
followed by 'Essays and Miscellanies.' So great was the influence of
her writings that the Jewesses of London gave her a public testimonial,
and addressed her as &quot;the first woman who had stood forth
as the public advocate of the faith of Israel.&quot; While on her way to
visit a brother then residing at Schwalbach, Germany, she was taken
ill at Frankfurt, and died there, at the early age of thirty-one.</p>

<p>The earliest and the best known of Miss Aguilar's novels is
'Home Influence,' which rapidly passed through thirty editions, and
is still a favorite book with young girls. There is little incident in
the story, which is the history of the development of character in a
household of six or seven young persons of very different endowments
and tendencies. It was the fashion of the day to be didactic,
and Mrs. Hamilton, from whom the &quot;home influence&quot; radiates, seems
to the modern reader somewhat inclined to preach, in season and out
of season. But the story is interesting, and the characters are distinctly
individualized, while at least one episode is dramatically
treated.</p>

<p>'The Mother's Recompense' is a sequel to 'Home Influence,'
wherein the further fortunes of the Hamilton family are so set forth
that the wordly-minded reader is driven to the inference that the
brilliant marriages of her children are a sensible part of Mrs. Hamilton's
&quot;recompense.&quot; The story is vividly and agreeably told.</p>

<p>Of a different order is 'The Days of Bruce,' a historic romance of
the late thirteenth century, which is less historic than romantic, and
in whose mirror the rugged chieftain would hardly recognize his
angularities.</p>

<p>'The Vale of Cedars' is a historic tale of the persecution of the
Jews in Spain under the Inquisition. It is told with intense feeling,
with much imagination, and with a strong love of local color. It is
said that family traditions are woven into the story. This book, as
well as 'Home Influence,' had a wide popularity in a German version.</p>

<p>In reading Grace Aguilar it is not easy to believe her the contemporary
of Currer Bell and George Eliot. Both her manner and her
method are earlier. Her lengthy and artificial periods, the rounded
and decorative sentences that she puts into the mouths of her characters
under the extremest pressure of emotion or suffering, the italics,
the sentimentalities, are of another age than the sinewy English and
hard sense of 'Jane Eyre' or 'Adam Bede.' Doubtless her peculiar,
sheltered training, her delicate health, and a luxuriant imagination
that had seldom been measured against the realities of life, account
for the old-fashioned air of her work. But however antiquated their
form may become, the substance of all her tales is sweet and sound,
their charm for young girls is abiding, their atmosphere is pure, and
the spirit that inspires them is touched only to fine issues.</p>

<p>The citation from 'The Days of Bruce' illustrates her narrative
style; that from 'Woman's Friendship' her habit of disquisition; and
the passage from 'Home Influence' her rendering of conversation.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_GREATNESS_OF_FRIENDSHIP"></a>THE GREATNESS OF FRIENDSHIP</h3>

<center>From 'Woman's Friendship'</center>
<br>

<p>It is the fashion to deride woman's influence over woman, to
laugh at female friendship, to look with scorn on all those
who profess it; but perhaps the world at large little knows
the effect of this influence,--how often the unformed character of
a young, timid, and gentle girl may be influenced for good or evil
by the power of an intimate female friend. There is always to
me a doubt of the warmth, the strength, and purity of her feelings,
when a young girl merges into womanhood, passing over
the threshold of actual life, seeking only the admiration of the
other sex; watching, pining, for a husband, or lovers, perhaps,
and looking down on all female friendship as romance and folly.
No young spirit was ever yet satisfied with the love of nature.</p>

<p>Friendship, or love, gratifies self-love; for it tacitly acknowledges
that we must possess some good qualities to attract beyond
the mere love of nature. Coleridge justly observes, &quot;that it is
well ordered that the amiable and estimable should have a fainter
perception of their own qualities than their friends have, otherwise
they would love themselves.&quot; Now, friendship, or love, permits
their doing this unconsciously: mutual affection is a tacit
avowal and appreciation of mutual good qualities,--perhaps
friendship yet more than love, for the latter is far more an aspiration,
a passion, than the former, and influences the permanent
character much less. Under the magic of love a girl is generally
in a feverish state of excitement, often in a wrong position,
deeming herself the goddess, her lover the adorer; whereas it
is her will that must bend to his, herself be abnegated for him.
Friendship neither permits the former nor demands the latter. It
influences silently, often unconsciously; perhaps its power is never
known till years afterwards. A girl who stands alone, without
acting or feeling friendship, is generally a cold unamiable being,
so wrapt in self as to have no room for any person else, except
perhaps a lover, whom she only seeks and values as offering
his devotion to that same idol, self. Female friendship may be
abused, may be but a name for gossip, letter-writing, romance,
nay worse, for absolute evil: but that Shakespeare, the mighty
wizard of human hearts, thought highly and beautifully of female
friendship, we have his exquisite portraits of Rosalind and Celia,
Helen and the Countess, undeniably to prove; and if he, who
could portray every human passion, every subtle feeling of
humanity, from the whelming tempest of love to the fiendish
influences of envy and jealousy and hate; from the incomprehensible
mystery of Hamlet's wondrous spirit, to the simplicity
of the gentle Miranda, the dove-like innocence of Ophelia, who
could be crushed by her weight of love, but not reveal it;--if
Shakespeare scorned not to picture the sweet influences of female
friendship, shall women pass by it as a theme too tame, too idle
for their pens?</p>

<h3><a name="THE_ORDER_OF_KNIGHTHOOD"></a>THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD</h3>

<center>From 'The Days of Bruce'</center>

<p>A right noble and glorious scene did the great hall of the palace
present the morning which followed this eventful night.
The king, surrounded by his highest prelates and nobles,
mingling indiscriminately with the high-born dames and maidens
of his court, all splendidly attired, occupied the upper part of the
hall, the rest of which was crowded by both his military followers
and many of the good citizens of Scone, who flocked in
great numbers to behold the august ceremony of the day. Two
immense oaken doors at the south side of the hall were flung
open, and through them was discerned the large space forming
the palace yard, prepared as a tilting-ground, where the new-made
knights were to prove their skill. The storm had given
place to a soft, breezy morning, the cool freshness of which
appeared peculiarly grateful from the oppressiveness of the night;
light downy clouds sailed over the blue expanse of heaven, tempering
without clouding the brilliant rays of the sun. Every
face was clothed with smiles, and the loud shouts which hailed
the youthful candidates for knighthood, as they severally entered,
told well the feeling with which the patriots of Scotland were
regarded.</p>

<p>Some twenty youths received the envied honor at the hand
of their sovereign this day; but our limits forbid a minute
scrutiny of the bearing of any, however well deserving, save of
the two whose vigils have already detained us so long. A yet
longer and louder shout proclaimed the appearance of the
youngest scion of the house of Bruce and his companion. The
daring patriotism of Isabella of Buchan had enshrined her in
every heart, and so disposed all men towards her children that
the name of their traitorous father was forgotten.</p>

<p>Led by their godfathers, Nigel by his brother-in-law Sir
Christopher Seaton, and Alan by the Earl of Lennox, their
swords, which had been blessed by the abbot at the altar, slung
round their necks, they advanced up the hall. There was a
glow on the cheek of the young Alan, in which pride and
modesty were mingled; his step at first was unsteady and his
lip was seen to quiver from very bashfulness, as he first glanced
round the hall and felt that every eye was turned toward him;
but when that glance met his mother's fixed on him, and breathing
that might of love that filled her heart, all boyish tremors
fled, the calm, staid resolve of manhood took the place of the
varying glow upon his cheek, the quivering lip became compressed
and firm, and his step faltered not again.</p>

<p>The cheek of Nigel Bruce was pale, but there was firmness
in the glance of his bright eye, and a smile unclouded in its
joyance on his lip. The frivolous lightness of the courtier, the
mad bravado of knight-errantry, which was not uncommon to
the times, indeed, were not there. It was the quiet courage of
the resolved warrior, the calm of a spirit at peace with itself,
shedding its own high feeling and poetic glory over all around
him.</p>

<p>On reaching the foot of King Robert's throne, both youths
knelt and laid their sheathed swords at his feet. Their armor-bearers
then approached, and the ceremony of clothing the candidates
in steel commenced; the golden spur was fastened on the
left foot of each by his respective godfather, while Athol, Hay,
and other nobles advanced to do honor to the youths, by aiding
in the ceremony. Nor was it warriors alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this permitted, lady?&quot; demanded the king, smiling, as
the Countess of Buchan approached the martial group, and,
aided by Lennox, fastened the polished cuirass on the form of
her son. &quot;Is it permitted for a matron to arm a youthful
knight? Is there no maiden to do such inspiring office?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, when the knight is one like this, my liege,&quot; she
answered, in the same tone. &quot;Let a matron arm him, good my
liege,&quot; she added, sadly: &quot;let a mother's hand enwrap his boyish
limbs in steel, a mother's blessing mark him thine and Scotland's,
that those who watch his bearing in the battle-field may
know who sent him there, may thrill his heart with memories
of her who stands alone of her ancestral line, that though he
bears the name of Comyn, the blood of Fife flows reddest in his
veins!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Arm him and welcome, noble lady,&quot; answered the king, and
a buzz of approbation ran through the hall; &quot;and may thy noble
spirit and dauntless loyalty inspire him: we shall not need a
trusty follower while such as he are around us. Yet, in very
deed, my youthful knight must have a lady fair for whom he
tilts to-day. Come hither, Isoline, thou lookest verily inclined
to envy thy sweet friend her office, and nothing loth to have a
loyal knight thyself. Come, come, my pretty one, no blushing
now. Lennox, guide those tiny hands aright.&quot;</p>

<p>Laughing and blushing, Isoline, the daughter of Lady Campbell,
a sister of the Bruce, a graceful child of some thirteen
summers, advanced nothing loth, to obey her royal uncle's summons;
and an arch smile of real enjoyment irresistibly stole over
the countenance of Alan, dispersing the emotion his mother's
words produced.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, tremble not, sweet one,&quot; the king continued, in a
lower and yet kinder tone, as he turned from the one youth to
the other, and observed that Agnes, overpowered by emotion,
had scarcely power to perform her part, despite the whispered
words of encouraging affection Nigel murmured in her ear. One
by one the cuirass and shoulder-pieces, the greaves and gauntlets,
the gorget and brassards, the joints of which were so beautifully
burnished that they shone as mirrors, and so flexible that
every limb had its free use, enveloped those manly forms. Their
swords once again girt to their sides, and once more kneeling,
the king descended from his throne, alternately dubbing them
knight in the name of God, St. Michael, and St. George.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CULPRIT_AND_THE_JUDGE"></a>THE CULPRIT AND THE JUDGE</h3>

<center>From 'Home Influence'</center>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton was seated at one of the tables on the dais
nearest the oriel window, the light from which fell on her,
giving her figure--though she was seated naturally enough
in one of the large maroon-velvet oaken chairs--an unusual
effect of dignity and command, and impressing the terrified
beholder with such a sensation of awe that had her life depended
on it, she could not for that one minute have gone forward; and
even when desired to do so by the words &quot;I desired your presence,
Ellen, because I wished to speak to you: come here without
any more delay,&quot;--how she walked the whole length of that
interminable room, and stood facing her aunt, she never knew.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton for a full minute did not speak, but she fixed
that searching look, to which we have once before alluded, upon
Ellen's face; and then said, in a tone which, though very low
and calm, expressed as much as that earnest look:--</p>

<p>&quot;Ellen! is it necessary for me to tell you why you are here--necessary
to produce the proof that my words are right, and that
you <i>have</i> been influenced by the fearful effects of some unconfessed
and most heinous sin? Little did I dream its nature.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment Ellen stood as turned to stone, as white and
rigid--the next she had sunk down with a wild, bitter cry, at
Mrs. Hamilton's feet, and buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it true--can it be true--that you, offspring of my own
sister; dear to me, cherished by me as my own child--you have
been the guilty one to appropriate, and conceal the appropriation
of money, which has been a source of distress by its loss, and
the suspicion thence proceeding, for the last seven weeks?--that
you could listen to your uncle's words, absolving his whole
household as incapable of a deed which was actual theft, and
yet, by neither word nor sign, betray remorse or guilt?--could
behold the innocent suffering, the fearful misery of suspicion,
loss of character, without the power of clearing himself, and
stand calmly, heedlessly by--only proving by your hardened
and rebellious temper that all was not right within--Ellen, can
this be true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; was the reply, but with such a fearful effort that her
slight frame shook as with an ague: &quot;thank God that it is known!
I dared not bring down the punishment on myself; but I can bear
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is mere mockery, Ellen: how dare I believe even this
poor evidence of repentance, with the recollection of your past
conduct? What were the notes you found?&quot;</p>

<p>Ellen named them.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are they?--This is but one, and the smallest.&quot;</p>

<p>Ellen's answer was scarcely audible.</p>

<p>&quot;Used them--and for what?&quot;</p>

<p>There was no answer; neither then nor when Mrs. Hamilton
sternly reiterated the question. She then demanded:--</p>

<p>&quot;How long have they been in your possession?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Five or six weeks;&quot; but the reply was so tremulous it carried
no conviction with it.</p>

<p>&quot;Since Robert told his story to your uncle, or before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then your last answer was a falsehood, Ellen: it is full seven
weeks since my husband addressed the household on the subject.
You could not have so miscounted time, with such a deed to date
by. Where did you find them?&quot;</p>

<p>Ellen described the spot.</p>

<p>&quot;And what business had you there? You know that neither
you nor your cousins are ever allowed to go that way to Mrs.
Langford's cottage, and more especially alone. If you wanted to
see her, why did you not go the usual way? And when was
this?--you must remember the exact day. Your memory is not
in general so treacherous.&quot;</p>

<p>Again Ellen was silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you forgotten it?&quot;</p>

<p>She crouched lower at her aunt's feet, but the answer was
audible--&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then answer me, Ellen, this moment, and distinctly: for
what purpose were you seeking Mrs. Langford's cottage by that
forbidden path, and when?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wanted money, and I went to ask her to take my trinkets--my
watch, if it must be--and dispose of them as I had read of
others doing, as miserable as I was; and the wind blew the notes
to my very hand, and I used them. I was mad then; I have
been mad since, I believe: but I would have returned the whole
amount to Robert if I could have but parted with my trinkets
in time.&quot;</p>

<p>To describe the tone of utter despair, the recklessness as to
the effect her words would produce, is impossible. Every word
increased Mrs. Hamilton's bewilderment and misery. To suppose
that Ellen did not feel was folly. It was the very depth of
wretchedness which was crushing her to earth, but every answered
and unanswered question but deepened the mystery, and rendered
her judge's task more difficult.</p>

<p>&quot;And when was this, Ellen? I will have no more evasion--tell
me the exact day.&quot;</p>

<p>But she asked in vain. Ellen remained moveless and silent as
the dead.</p>

<p>After several minutes Mrs. Hamilton removed her hands from
her face, and compelling her to lift up her head, gazed searchingly
on her death-like countenance for some moments in utter
silence, and then said, in a tone that Ellen never in her life
forgot:--</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot imagine, Ellen, that this half confession will
either satisfy me, or in the smallest degree redeem your sin.
One, and one only path is open to you; for all that you have
said and left unsaid but deepens your apparent guilt, and so
blackens your conduct, that I can scarcely believe I am addressing
the child I so loved--and could still so love, if but one real
sign be given of remorse and penitence--one hope of returning
truth. But that sign, that hope, can only be a full confession.
Terrible as is the guilt of appropriating so large a sum, granted
it came by the merest chance into your hand; dark as is the additional
sin of concealment when an innocent person was suffering--something
still darker, more terrible, must be concealed
behind it, or you would not, could not, continue thus obdurately
silent. I can believe that under some heavy pressure of misery,
some strong excitement, the sum might have been used without
thought, and that fear might have prevented the confession of
anything so dreadful; but what was this heavy necessity for
money, this strong excitement? What fearful and mysterious
difficulties have you been led into to call for either? Tell me
the truth, Ellen, the whole truth; let me have some hope of saving
you and myself the misery of publicly declaring you the
guilty one, and so proving Robert's innocence. Tell me what
difficulty, what misery so maddened you, as to demand the disposal
of your trinkets. If there be the least excuse, the smallest
possibility of your obtaining in time forgiveness, I will grant it.
I will not believe you so utterly fallen. I will do all I can to
remove error, and yet to prevent suffering; but to win this, I
must have a full confession--every question that I put to you
must be clearly and satisfactorily answered, and so bring back the
only comfort to yourself, and hope to me. Will you do this,
Ellen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh that I could!&quot; was the reply in such bitter anguish, Mrs.
Hamilton actually shuddered. &quot;But I cannot--must not--dare
not. Aunt Emmeline, hate me; condemn me to the severest,
sharpest suffering; I wish for it, pine for it: you cannot loathe
me more than I do myself, but do not--do not speak to me in
these kind tones--I cannot bear them. It was because I knew
what a wretch I am, that I have so shunned you. I was not
worthy to be with you; oh, sentence me at once! I dare not
answer as you wish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dare not!&quot; repeated Mrs. Hamilton, more and more bewildered;
and to conceal the emotion Ellen's wild words and agonized
manner had produced, adopting a greater sternness.</p>

<p>&quot;You dare commit a sin, from which the lowest of my household
would shrink in horror, and yet tell me you dare not make
the only atonement, give me the only proof of real penitence I
demand. This is a weak and wicked subterfuge, Ellen, and will
not pass with me. There can be no reason for this fearful obduracy,
not even the consciousness of greater guilt, for I promise
forgiveness, if it be possible, on the sole condition of a full confession.
Once more, will you speak? Your hardihood will be utterly
useless, for you cannot hope to conquer me; and if you permit
me to leave you with your conduct still clothed in this impenetrable
mystery, you will compel me to adopt measures to subdue
that defying spirit, which will expose you and myself to intense
suffering, but which <i>must</i> force submission at last.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot inflict more than I have endured the last seven
weeks,&quot; murmured Ellen, almost inarticulately. &quot;I have borne
that; I can bear the rest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you will not answer? You are resolved not to tell me
the day on which you found that money, the use to which it was
applied, the reason of your choosing that forbidden path, permitting
me to believe you guilty of heavier sins than may be the
case in reality. Listen to me, Ellen; it is more than time this
interview should cease; but I will give you one chance more. It
is now half-past seven,&quot;--she took the watch from her neck, and
laid it on the table--&quot;I will remain here one-half hour longer:
by that time this sinful temper may have passed away, and you
will consent to give me the confession I demand. I cannot
believe you so altered in two months as to choose obduracy and
misery, when pardon, and in time confidence and love, are
offered in their stead. Get up from that crouching posture; it
can be but mock humility, and so only aggravates your sin.&quot;</p>

<p>Ellen rose slowly and painfully, and seating herself at the
table some distance from her aunt, leaned her arms upon it, and
buried her face within them. Never before and never after did
half an hour appear so interminable to either Mrs. Hamilton or
Ellen. It was well for the firmness of the former, perhaps, that
she could not read the heart of that young girl, even if the cause
of its anguish had been still concealed. Again and again did the
wild longing, turning her actually faint and sick with its agony,
come over her to reveal the whole, to ask but rest and mercy
for herself, pardon and security for Edward: but then, clear as if
held before her in letters of fire, she read every word of her
brother's desperate letter, particularly &quot;Breathe it to my uncle or
aunt--for if she knows it he will--and you will never see me
more.&quot; Her mother, pallid as death, seemed to stand before
her, freezing confession on her heart and lips, looking at her
threateningly, as she had so often seen her, as if the very
thought were guilt. The rapidly advancing twilight, the large
and lonely room, all added to that fearful illusion; and if Ellen
did succeed in praying it was with desperate fervor for strength
not to betray her brother. If ever there were a martyr spirit,
it was enshrined in that young, frail form.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Emmeline, Aunt Emmeline, speak to me but one
word--only one word of kindness before you go. I do not
ask for mercy--there can be none for such a wretch as I am;
I will bear without one complaint, one murmur, all you may
inflict--you cannot be too severe. Nothing can be such agony as
the utter loss of your affection; I thought, the last two months,
that I feared you so much that it was all fear, no love: but now,
now that you know my sin, it has all, all come back to make me
still more wretched.&quot; And before Mrs. Hamilton could prevent,
or was in the least aware of her intention, Ellen had obtained
possession of one of her hands, and was covering it with kisses,
while her whole frame shook with those convulsed, but completely
tearless sobs.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you confess, Ellen, if I stay? Will you give me the
proof that it <i>is</i> such agony to lose my affection, that you <i>do</i> love
me as you profess, and that it is only one sin which has so
changed you? One word, and, tardy as it is, I will listen, and it
I can, forgive.&quot;</p>

<p>Ellen made no answer, and Mrs. Hamilton's newly raised hopes
vanished; she waited full two or three minutes, then gently disengaged
her hand and dress from Ellen's still convulsive grasp;
the door closed, with a sullen, seemingly unwilling sound, and
Ellen was alone. She remained in the same posture, the same
spot, till a vague, cold terror so took possession of her, that the
room seemed filled with ghostly shapes, and all the articles of furniture
suddenly transformed to things of life; and springing up,
with the wild, fleet step of fear, she paused not till she found
herself in her own room, where, flinging herself on her bed, she
buried her face on her pillow, to shut out every object--oh, how
she longed to shut out thought!</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_HARRISON_AINSWORTH"></a>WILLIAM HARRISON AINSWORTH</h2>

<h3>(1805-1882)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-i.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>n the year 1881, at a commemorative dinner given to her
native novelist by the city of Manchester, it was announced
that the public library contained two hundred and fifty
volumes of his works, which passed through seven thousand six
hundred and sixty hands annually, so that his stories were read at
the rate of twenty volumes a day throughout the year. This exceptional
prophet, who was thus not without honor in his own country,
was the son of a prosperous attorney, and was himself destined to
the bar. But he detested the law and he loved letters, and before he
was twenty he had helped to edit a paper, had written essays, a story,
and a play,--none of which, fortunately for him, survive,--and had
gone to London, ostensibly to read in a lawyer's office, and really to
spin his web of fiction whenever opportunity offered. Chance connected
the fortunes of young Ainsworth with periodical literature,
where most of his early work appeared. His first important tale was
'Rookwood,' published in 1834. This describes the fortunes of a
family of Yorkshire gentry in the last century; but its real interest
lies in an episode which includes certain experiences of the notorious
highwayman, Dick Turpin, and his furious ride to outrun the
hue and cry. Sporting England was enraptured with the dash and
breathlessness of this adventure, and the novelist's fame was established.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/252.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>His second romance, 'Crichton,' appeared in 1836. The hero
of this tale is the brilliant Scottish gentleman whose handsome
person, extraordinary scholarship, great
accomplishments, courage, eloquence, subtlety,
and achievement gained him the
sobriquet of &quot;The Admirable.&quot; The chief
scenes are laid in Paris at the time of
Catherine de' Medici's rule and Henry
III.'s reign, when the air was full of intrigue
and conspiracy, and when religious
quarrels were not more bitter and dangerous
than political wrangles. The inscrutable
king, the devout Queen Louise of
Lorraine, the scheming queen-mother, and
Marguerite of Valois, half saint, half profligate,
a pearl of beauty and grace; Henry
of Navarre, ready to buy his Paris with
sword or mass; well-known great nobles, priests, astrologers, learned
doctors, foreign potentates, ambassadors, pilgrims, and poisoners,--pass
before the reader's eye. The pictures of student life, at a time
when all the world swarmed to the great schools of Paris, serve to
explain the hero and the period.</p>

<p>When, in 1839, Dickens resigned the editorship of Bentley's Miscellany,
Ainsworth succeeded him. &quot;The new whip,&quot; wrote the old
one afterward, &quot;having mounted the box, drove straight to Newgate.
He there took in Jack Sheppard, and Cruikshank the artist; and
aided by that very vulgar but very wonderful draughtsman, he made
an effective story of the burglar's and housebreaker's life.&quot; Everybody
read the story, and most persons cried out against so ignoble a
hero, so mean a history, and so misdirected a literary energy. The
author himself seems not to have been proud of the success which
sold thousands of copies of an unworthy book, and placed a dramatic
version of its vulgar adventures on the stage of eight theatres at
once. He turned his back on this profitable field to produce, in rapid
succession, 'Guy Fawkes,' a tale of the famous Gunpowder Plot;
'The Tower of London,' a story of the Princess Elizabeth, the reign
of Queen Mary, and the melancholy episode of Lady Jane Grey's
brief glory; 'Old Saint Paul,' a story of the time of Charles II.,
which contains the history of the Plague and of the Great Fire;
'The Miser's Daughter'; 'Windsor Castle,' whose chief characters
are Katharine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Cardinal Wolsey, and Henry
the Eighth; 'St. James,' a tale of the court of Queen Anne; 'The
Lancashire Witches'; 'The Star-Chamber,' a historical story of the
time of Charles I.; 'The Constable of the Tower'; 'The Lord Mayor
of London'; 'Cardinal Pole,' which deals with the court and times of
Philip and Mary; 'John Law,' a story of the great Mississippi Bubble;
'Tower Hill,' whose heroine is the luckless Catharine Howard;
'The Spanish Match,' a story of the romantic pilgrimage of Prince
Charles and &quot;Steenie&quot; Buckingham to Spain for the fruitless wooing
of the Spanish Princess; and at least ten other romances, many of
them in three volumes, all appearing between 1840 and 1873. Two
of these were published simultaneously, in serial form; and no year
passed without its book, to the end of the novelist's long life.</p>

<p>Whatever the twentieth century may say to Ainsworth's historic
romances, many of them have found high favor in the past. Concerning
'Crichton,' so good a critic as &quot;Father Prout&quot; wrote:--&quot;Indeed,
I scarcely know any of the so-called historical novels of this
frivolous generation which has altogether so graphically reproduced
the spirit and character of the time as this daring and dashing portraiture
of the young Scot and his contemporaries.&quot; The author of
'Waverley' praised more than one of the romances, saying that they
were written in his own vein. Even Maginn, the satirical, thought
that the novelist was doing excellent service to history in making
Englishmen understand how full of comedy and tragedy were the old
streets and the old buildings of London. And if Ainsworth the
writer received some buffetings, Ainsworth the man seems to have
been universally loved and approved. All the literary men of his
time were his cordial friends. Scott wrote for him 'The Bonnets
of Bonnie Dundee,' and objected to being paid. Dickens was eager
to serve him. Talfourd, Barham, Hood, Howitt, James, Jerrold,
delighted in his society. At dinner-parties and in country-houses he
was a favorite guest. Thus, easy in circumstances, surrounded by
affection, happy in the labor of his choice, passed the long life of
the upright and kindly English gentleman who spent fifty industrious
years in recording the annals of tragedy, wretchedness, and crime.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_STUDENTS_OF_PARIS"></a>THE STUDENTS OF PARIS</h3>

<center>From 'Crichton'</center>

<p>Toward the close of Wednesday, the 4th of February, 1579, a
vast assemblage of scholars was collected before the Gothic
gateway of the ancient College of Navarre. So numerous
was this concourse, that it not merely blocked up the area in
front of the renowned seminary in question, but extended far
down the Rue de la Montagne Sainte-G&eacute;n&eacute;vi&egrave;ve, in which it is
situated. Never had such a disorderly rout been brought together
since the days of the uproar in 1557, when the predecessors of
these turbulent students took up arms, marched in a body to the
Pr&eacute;-aux-Clercs, set fire to three houses in the vicinity, and slew
a sergeant of the guard, who vainly endeavored to restrain their
fury. Their last election of a rector, Messire Adrien d'Amboise,--<i>pater
eruditionum</i>, as he is described in his epitaph, when the
same body congregated within the cloisters of the Mathurins, and
thence proceeded, in tumultuous array, to the church of Saint
Louis, in the isle of the same name,--had been nothing to it.
Every scholastic hive sent forth its drones. Sorbonne, and Montaigu,
Cluny, Harcourt, the Four Nations, and a host of minor
establishments--in all, amounting to forty-two--each added its
swarms; and a pretty buzzing they created! The fair of Saint-Germain
had only commenced the day before; but though its
festivities were to continue until Palm Sunday, and though it was
the constant resort of the scholars, who committed, during their
days of carnival, ten thousand excesses, it was now absolutely
deserted.</p>

<p>The Pomme-de-Pin, the Castel, the Magdaleine, and the Mule,
those &quot;capital caverns,&quot; celebrated in Pantagruel's conference with
the Limosin student, which has conferred upon them an immortality
like that of our own hostel, the Mermaid, were wholly
neglected; the dice-box was laid aside for the nonce; and the
well-used cards were thrust into the doublets of these thirsty
tipplers of the schools.</p>

<p>But not alone did the crowd consist of the brawler, the
gambler, the bully, and the debauchee, though these, it must be
confessed, predominated. It was a grand medley of all sects and
classes. The modest demeanor of the retiring, pale-browed student
was contrasted with the ferocious aspect and reckless bearing
of his immediate neighbor, whose appearance was little better
than that of a bravo. The grave theologian and embryo ecclesiastic
were placed in juxtaposition with the scoffing and licentious
acolyte; while the lawyer <i>in posse</i>, and the law-breaker <i>in esse</i>,
were numbered among a group whose pursuits were those of violence
and fraud.</p>

<p>Various as were the characters that composed it, not less
diversified were the costumes of this heterogeneous assemblage.
Subject to no particular regulations as to dress, or rather openly
infracting them, if any such were attempted to be enforced--each
scholar, to whatever college he belonged, attired himself in
such garments as best suited his taste or his finances. Taking it
altogether, the mob was neither remarkable for the fashion, nor
the cleanliness of the apparel of its members.</p>

<p>From Rabelais we learn that the passion of play was so
strongly implanted in the students of his day, that they would
frequently stake the points of their doublets at <i>tric-trac</i>
or <i>troumadame</i>;
and but little improvement had taken place in their
morals or manners some half-century afterward. The buckle at
their girdle--the mantle on their shoulders--the shirt to their
back--often stood the hazard of the die; and hence it not unfrequently
happened, that a rusty <i>pourpoint</i> and ragged <i>chauss&eacute;s</i>
were all the covering which the luckless dicers could enumerate,
owing, no doubt, &quot;to the extreme rarity and penury of money in
their pouches.&quot;</p>

<p>Round or square caps, hoods and cloaks of black, gray, or
other sombre hue, were, however, the prevalent garb of the members
of the university; but here and there might be seen some
gayer specimen of the tribe, whose broad-brimmed, high-crowned
felt hat and flaunting feather; whose puffed-out sleeves and exaggerated
ruff--with starched plaits of such amplitude that they
had been not inappropriately named <i>plats de Saint Jean-Baptiste</i>,
from the resemblance which the wearer's head bore to that of the
saint, when deposited in the charger of the daughter of Herodias--were
intended to ape the leading mode of the elegant court of
their sovereign, Henri Trois.</p>

<p>To such an extent had these insolent youngsters carried their
license of imitation that certain of their members, fresh from the
fair of Saint-Germain, and not wholly unacquainted with the
hippocras of the sutlers crowding its mart, wore around their
throats enormous collars of paper, cut in rivalry of the legitimate
plaits of muslin, and bore in their hands long hollow sticks from
which they discharged peas and other missiles, in imitation of the
<i>sarbacanes</i> or pea-shooters then in vogue with the monarch and
his favorites.</p>

<p>Thus fantastically tricked out, on that same day--nay, only
a few hours before, and at the fair above mentioned--had these
facetious wights, with more merriment than discretion, ventured
to exhibit themselves before the cortege of Henri, and to exclaim
loud enough to reach the ears of royalty, &quot;<i>&agrave; la fraise on connoit
le veau</i>!&quot; a piece of pleasantry for which they subsequently paid
dear.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its shabby appearance in detail, the general
effect of this scholastic rabble was striking and picturesque. The
thick mustaches and pointed beards with which the lips and
chins of most of them were decorated, gave to their physiognomies
a manly and determined air, fully borne out by their unrestrained
carriage and deportment. To a man, almost all were
armed with a tough vine-wood bludgeon, called in their language
an <i>estoc volant</i>, tipped and shod with steel--a weapon fully
understood by them, and rendered, by their dexterity in the use
of it, formidable to their adversaries. Not a few carried at
their girdles the short rapier, so celebrated in their duels and
brawls, or concealed within their bosom a poniard or a two-edged
knife.</p>

<p>The scholars of Paris have ever been a turbulent and ungovernable
race; and at the period of which this history treats, and
indeed long before, were little better than a licensed horde of
robbers, consisting of a pack of idle and wayward youths drafted
from all parts of Europe, as well as from the remoter provinces
of their own nation. There was little in common between the
mass of students and their brethren, excepting the fellowship
resulting from the universal license in which all indulged. Hence
their thousand combats among themselves--combats almost invariably
attended with fatal consequences--and which the heads of
the university found it impossible to check.</p>

<p>Their own scanty resources, eked out by what little they could
derive from beggary or robbery, formed their chief subsistence;
for many of them were positive mendicants, and were so denominated:
and being possessed of a sanctuary within their own
quarters, to which they could at convenience retire, they submitted
to the constraint of no laws except those enforced within
the jurisdiction of the university, and hesitated at no means of
enriching themselves at the expense of their neighbors. Hence
the frequent warfare waged between them and the brethren of
Saint-Germain des Pr&eacute;s, whose monastic domains adjoined their
territories, and whose meadows were the constant battleground of
their skirmishes; according to Dulaure--&quot;<i>presque toujours un
th&eacute;&acirc;tre de tumulte, de galanterie, de combats, de duels, de d&eacute;bauches
et de s&eacute;dition</i>.&quot; Hence their sanguinary conflicts with the good
citizens of Paris, to whom they were wholly obnoxious, and who
occasionally repaid their aggressions with interest. In 1407 two
of their number, convicted of assassination and robbery, were condemned
to the gibbet, and the sentence was carried into execution;
but so great was the uproar occasioned in the university by this
violation of its immunities that the Provost of Paris, Guillaume de
Tignonville, was compelled to take down their bodies from Montfaucon
and see them honorably and ceremoniously interred. This
recognition of their rights only served to make matters worse, and
for a series of years the nuisance continued unabated.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to record all the excesses of the university,
nor the means taken for their suppression. Vainly were
the civil authorities arrayed against them. Vainly were bulls
thundered from the Vatican. No amendment was effected. The
weed might be cut down, but was never entirely extirpated.
Their feuds were transmitted from generation to generation, and
their old bone of contention with the abbot of Saint-Germain (the
Pr&eacute;-aux-Clercs) was, after an uninterrupted strife for thirty years,
submitted to the arbitration of the Pope, who very equitably
refused to pronounce judgment in favor of either party.</p>

<p>Such were the scholars of Paris in the sixteenth century--such
the character of the clamorous crew who besieged the portals
of the College of Navarre.</p>

<p>The object that summoned together this unruly multitude
was, it appears, a desire on the part of the scholars to be present
at a public controversy or learned disputation, then occurring
within the great hall of the college before which they were
congregated; and the disappointment caused by their finding the
gates closed, and all entrance denied to them, occasioned their
present disposition to riot.</p>

<p>It was in vain they were assured by the halberdiers stationed
at the gates, and who, with crossed pikes, strove to resist the
onward pressure of the mob, that the hall and court were already
crammed to overflowing, that there was not room even for the
sole of a foot of a doctor of the faculties, and that their orders
were positive and imperative that none beneath the degree of a
bachelor or licentiate should be admitted, and that a troop of martinets
and new-comers could have no possible claim to admission.</p>

<p>In vain they were told this was no ordinary disputation, no
common controversy, where all were alike entitled to license of
ingress; that the disputant was no undistinguished scholar, whose
renown did not extend beyond his own trifling sphere, and
whose opinions, therefore, few would care to hear and still
fewer to oppugn, but a foreigner of high rank, in high favor and
fashion, and not more remarkable for his extraordinary intellectual
endowments than for his brilliant personal accomplishments.</p>

<p>In vain the trembling officials sought to clinch their arguments
by stating, that not alone did the conclave consist of the chief
members of the university, the senior doctors of theology, medicine,
and law, the professors of the humanities, rhetoric, and philosophy,
and all the various other dignitaries; but that the debate
was honored by the presence of Monsieur Christophe de Thou,
first president of Parliament; by that of the learned Jacques
Augustin, of the same name; by one of the secretaries of state
and Governor of Paris, M. Ren&eacute; de Villequier; by the ambassadors
of Elizabeth, Queen of England, and of Philip the Second,
King of Spain, and several of their suite; by Abb&eacute; de Brant&ocirc;me;
by M. Miron, the court physician; by Cosmo Ruggieri, the
Queen Mother's astrologer; by the renowned poets and masque
writers, Ma&icirc;tres Ronsard, Ba&iuml;f, and Philippe Desportes; by the
well-known advocate of Parliament, Messire &Eacute;tienne Pasquier:
but also (and here came the gravamen of the objection to their
admission) by the two especial favorites of his Majesty and leaders
of affairs, the seigneurs of Joyeuse and D'Epernon.</p>

<p>It was in vain the students were informed that for the preservation
of strict decorum, they had been commanded by the rector
to make fast the gates. No excuses would avail them. The
scholars were cogent reasoners, and a show of staves soon
brought their opponents to a nonplus. In this line of argument
they were perfectly aware of their ability to prove a major.</p>

<p>&quot;To the wall with them--to the wall!&quot; cried a hundred infuriated
voices. &quot;Down with the halberdiers--down with the gates--down
with the disputants--down with the rector himself!--Deny
our privileges! To the wall with old Adrien d'Amboise--exclude
the disciples of the university from their own halls!--curry
favor with the court minions!--hold a public controversy
in private!--down with him! We will issue a mandamus for a
new election on the spot!&quot;</p>

<p>Whereupon a deep groan resounded throughout the crowd.
It was succeeded by a volley of fresh execrations against the
rector, and an angry demonstration of bludgeons, accompanied by
a brisk shower of peas from the <i>sarbacanes</i>.</p>

<p>The officials turned pale, and calculated the chance of a broken
neck in reversion, with that of a broken crown in immediate
possession. The former being at least contingent, appeared the
milder alternative, and they might have been inclined to adopt
it had not a further obstacle stood in their way. The gate was
barred withinside, and the vergers and bedels who had the custody
of the door, though alarmed at the tumult without, positively
refused to unfasten it.</p>

<p>Again the threats of the scholars were renewed, and further
intimations of violence were exhibited. Again the peas rattled
upon the hands and faces of the halberdiers, till their ears tingled
with pain. &quot;Prate to us of the king's favorites,&quot; cried one of the
foremost of the scholars, a youth decorated with a paper collar:
&quot;they may rule within the precincts of the Louvre, but not
within the walls of the university. <i>Maugre-bleu!</i> We hold them
cheap enough. We heed not the idle bark of these full-fed court
lapdogs. What to us is the bearer of a cup and ball? By the
four Evangelists, we will have none of them here! Let the Gascon
cadet, D'Epernon, reflect on the fate of Qu&eacute;lus and Maugiron,
and let our gay Joyeuse beware of the dog's death of Saint-M&eacute;grin.
Place for better men--place for the schools--away with
frills and <i>sarbacanes</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What to us is a president of Parliament, or a governor of the
city?&quot; shouted another of the same gentry. &quot;We care nothing
for their ministration. We recognize them not, save in their own
courts. All their authority fell to the ground at the gate of the
Rue Saint Jacques, when they entered our dominions. We care
for no parties. We are trimmers, and steer a middle course. We
hold the Guisards as cheap as the Huguenots, and the brethren
of the League weigh as little with us as the followers of Calvin.
Our only sovereign is Gregory the Thirteenth, Pontiff of Rome.
Away with the Guise and the B&eacute;arnaise!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Away with Henri of Navarre, if you please,&quot; cried a scholar
of Harcourt; &quot;or Henri of Valois, if you list: but by all the
saints, not with Henri of Lorraine; he is the fast friend of the
true faith. No!--No!--live the Guise--live the Holy Union!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Away with Elizabeth of England,&quot; cried a scholar of Cluny:
&quot;what doth her representative here? Seeks he a spouse for her
among our schools? She will have no great bargain, I own, if
she bestows her royal hand upon our Duc d'Anjou.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you value your buff jerkin, I counsel you to say nothing
slighting of the Queen of England in my hearing,&quot; returned a
bluff, broad-shouldered fellow, raising his bludgeon after a menacing
fashion. He was an Englishman belonging to the Four
Nations, and had a huge bull-dog at his heels.</p>

<p>&quot;Away with Philip of Spain and his ambassador,&quot; cried a
Bernardin.</p>

<p>&quot;By the eyes of my mistress!&quot; cried a Spaniard belonging to
the College of Narbonne, with huge mustaches curled half-way
up his bronzed and insolent visage, and a slouched hat pulled
over his brow. &quot;This may not pass muster. The representative
of the King of Spain must be respected even by the Academics
of Lutetia. Which of you shall gainsay me?--ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What business has he here with his suite, on occasions like
to the present?&quot; returned the Bernardin. &quot;<i>T&ecirc;te-Dieu!</i> this disputation
is one that little concerns the interest of your politic king;
and methinks Don Philip, or his representative, has regard for
little else than whatsoever advances his own interest. Your
ambassador hath, I doubt not, some latent motive for his present
attendance in our schools.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perchance,&quot; returned the Spaniard. &quot;We will discuss that
point anon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what doth the pander of the Sybarite within the dusty
halls of learning?&quot; ejaculated a scholar of Lemoine. &quot;What
doth the jealous-pated slayer of his wife and unborn child within
the reach of free-spoken voices, and mayhap of well-directed
blades? Methinks it were more prudent to tarry within the
bowers of his harem, than to hazard his perfumed person among
us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well said,&quot; rejoined the scholar of Cluny--&quot;down with
Ren&eacute; de Villequier, though he be Governor of Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What title hath the Abb&eacute; de Brant&ocirc;me to a seat among
us?&quot; said the scion of Harcourt: &quot;faith, he hath a reputation for
wit, and scholarship, and gallantry. But what is that to us?
His place might now be filled by worthier men.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what, in the devil's name, brings Cosmo Ruggieri
hither?&quot; asked the Bernardin. &quot;What doth the wrinkled old
dealer in the black art hope to learn from us? We are not
given to alchemy, and the occult sciences; we practice no hidden
mysteries; we brew no philtres; we compound no slow poisons;
we vend no waxen images. What doth he here, I say! 'Tis a
scandal in the rector to permit his presence. And what if he
came under the safeguard, and by the authority of his mistress,
Catherine de' Medicis! Shall we regard her passport? Down
with the heathen abb&eacute;, his abominations have been endured too
long; they smell rank in our nostrils. Think how he ensnared
La Mole--think on his numberless victims. Who mixed the
infernal potion of Charles the Ninth? Let him answer that.
Down with the infidel--the Jew--the sorcerer! The stake were
too good for him. Down with Ruggieri, I say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, down with the accursed astrologer,&quot; echoed the whole
crew. &quot;He has done abundant mischief in his time. A day of
reckoning has arrived. Hath he cast his own horoscope? Did
he foresee his own fate? Ha! ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then the poets,&quot; cried another member of the Four
Nations--&quot;a plague on all three. Would they were elsewhere.
In what does this disputation concern them? Pierre Ronsard,
being an offshoot of this same College of Navarre, hath indubitably
a claim upon our consideration. But he is old, and I
marvel that his gout permitted him to hobble so far. Oh, the
mercenary old scribbler! His late verses halt like himself, yet
he lowereth not the price of his masques. Besides which, he is
grown moral, and unsays all his former good things. <i>Mort
Dieu!</i> your superannuated bards ever recant the indiscretions
of their nonage. Cl&eacute;ment Marot took to psalm-writing in his
old age. As to Ba&iuml;f, his name will scarce outlast the scenery
of his ballets, his plays are out of fashion since the Gelosi
arrived. He deserves no place among us. And Philip Desportes
owes all his present preferment to the Vicomte de Joyeuse.
However, he is not altogether devoid of merit--let him wear
his bays, so he trouble us not with his company. Room for the
sophisters of Narbonne, I say. To the dogs with poetry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Morbleu!</i>&quot; exclaimed another. &quot;What are the sophisters
of Narbonne to the decretists of the Sorbonne, who will discuss
you a position of Cornelius &agrave; Lapide, or a sentence of Peter
Lombard, as readily as you would a flask of hippocras, or a slice
of botargo. Aye, and cry <i>transeat</i> to a thesis of Aristotle,
though it be against rule. What sayst thou, Cap&eacute;te?&quot; continued
he, addressing his neighbor, a scholar of Montaigu, whose
modest gray capuchin procured him this appellation: &quot;are we the
men to be thus scurvily entreated?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see not that your merits are greater than ours,&quot; returned
he of the capuch, &quot;though our boasting be less. The followers
of the lowly John Standoncht are as well able to maintain their
tenets in controversy as those of Robert of Sorbon; and I see no
reason why entrance should be denied us. The honor of the
university is at stake, and all its strength should be mustered to
assert it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rightly spoken,&quot; returned the Bernardin; &quot;and it were a
lasting disgrace to our schools were this arrogant Scot to carry
off their laurels when so many who might have been found
to lower his crest are allowed no share in their defense. The
contest is one that concerns us all alike. We at least can arbitrate
in case of need.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I care not for the honors of the university,&quot; rejoined one
of the &Eacute;cossais, or Scotch College, then existing in the Rue des
Amandiers, &quot;but I care much for the glory of my countryman,
and I would gladly have witnessed the triumph of the disciples of
Rutherford and of the classic Buchanan. But if the arbitrament
to which you would resort is to be that of voices merely, I am
glad the rector in his wisdom has thought fit to keep you without,
even though I myself be personally inconvenienced by it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Name o' God! what fine talking is this?&quot; retorted the Spaniard.
&quot;There is little chance of the triumph you predicate for
your countryman. Trust me, we shall have to greet his departure
from the debate with many hisses and few cheers; and if we
could penetrate through the plates of yon iron door, and gaze
into the court it conceals from our view, we should find that the
loftiness of his pretensions has been already humbled, and his
arguments graveled. <i>For la Litania de los Santos!</i> to think of
comparing an obscure student of the pitiful College of Saint
Andrew with the erudite doctors of the most erudite university
in the world, always excepting those of Valencia and Salamanca.
It needs all thy country's assurance to keep the blush of shame
from mantling in thy cheeks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The seminary you revile,&quot; replied the Scot, haughtily, &quot;has
been the nursery of our Scottish kings. Nay, the youthful James
Stuart pursued his studies under the same roof, beneath the same
wise instruction, and at the self-same time as our noble and gifted
James Crichton, whom you have falsely denominated an adventurer,
but whose lineage is not less distinguished than his learning.
His renown has preceded him hither, and he was not
unknown to your doctors when he affixed his programme to these
college walls. Hark!&quot; continued the speaker, exultingly, &quot;and
listen to yon evidence of his triumph.&quot;</p>

<p>And as he spoke, a loud and continued clapping of hands proceeding
from within was distinctly heard above the roar of the
students.</p>

<p>&quot;That may be at his defeat,&quot; muttered the Spaniard, between
his teeth.</p>

<p>&quot;No such thing,&quot; replied the Scot. &quot;I heard the name of
Crichton mingled with the plaudits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who may be this Phoenix--this Gargantua of intellect--who
is to vanquish us all, as Panurge did Thaumast, the
Englishman?&quot; asked the Sorbonist of the Scot. &quot;Who is he that
is more philosophic than Pythagoras?--ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is more studious than Carneades!&quot; said the Bernardin.</p>

<p>&quot;More versatile than Alcibiades!&quot; said Montaigu.</p>

<p>&quot;More subtle than Averro&euml;s!&quot; cried Harcourt.</p>

<p>&quot;More mystical than Plotinus!&quot; said one of the Four Nations.</p>

<p>&quot;More visionary than Artemidorus!&quot; said Cluny.</p>

<p>&quot;More infallible than the Pope!&quot; added Lemoine.</p>

<p>&quot;And who pretends to dispute <i>de omni scibili</i>,&quot; shouted the
Spaniard.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Et quolibet ente!</i>! added the Sorbonist.</p>

<p>&quot;Mine ears are stunned with your vociferations,&quot; replied the
Scot. &quot;You ask me who James Crichton is, and yourselves give
the response. You have mockingly said he is a <i>rara avis</i>; a
prodigy of wit and learning: and you have unintentionally spoken
the truth. He is so. But I will tell you that of him of which
you are wholly ignorant, or which you have designedly overlooked.
His condition is that of a Scottish gentleman of high
rank. Like your Spanish grandee, he need not doff his cap to
kings. On either side hath he the best of blood in his veins.
His mother was a Stuart directly descended from that regal line.
His father, who owneth the fair domains of Eliock and Cluny,
was Lord Advocate to our bonny and luckless Mary (whom
Heaven assoilzie!) and still holds his high office. Methinks the
Lairds of Crichton might have been heard of here. Howbeit,
they are well known to me, who being an Ogilvy of
Balfour, have often heard tell of a certain contract or obligation,
whereby--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Basta!</i>&quot; interrupted the Spaniard, &quot;heed not thine own
affairs, worthy Scot. Tell us of this Crichton--ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have told you already more than I ought to have told,&quot;
replied Ogilvy, sullenly. &quot;And if you lack further information
respecting James Crichton's favor at the Louvre, his feats of
arms, and the esteem in which he is held by all the dames of
honor in attendance upon your Queen Mother, Catherine de'
Medicis--and moreover,&quot; he added, with somewhat of sarcasm,
&quot;with her fair daughter, Marguerite de Valois--you will do well
to address yourself to the king's buffoon, Ma&icirc;tre Chicot, whom I
see not far off. Few there are, methinks, who could in such
short space have won so much favor, or acquired such bright
renown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Humph!&quot; muttered the Englishman, &quot;your Scotsmen stick
by each other all the world over. This James Crichton may or
may not be the hero he is vaunted, but I shall mistrust his
praises from that quarter, till I find their truth confirmed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has, to be sure, acquired the character of a stout swords-man,&quot;
said the Bernardin, &quot;to give the poor devil his due.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has not met with his match at the <i>salle-d'armes</i>, though
he has crossed blades with the first in France,&quot; replied Ogilvy.</p>

<p>&quot;I have seen him at the Man&eacute;ge,&quot; said the Sorbonist, &quot;go
through his course of equitation, and being a not altogether
unskillful horseman myself, I can report favorably of his performance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is none among your youth can sit a steed like him,&quot;
returned Ogilvy, &quot;nor can any of the jousters carry off the ring
with more certainty at the lists. I would fain hold my tongue,
but you enforce me to speak in his praise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Body of Bacchus!&quot; exclaimed the Spaniard, half unsheathing
the lengthy weapon that hung by his side, &quot;I will hold you a
wager of ten rose-nobles to as many silver reals of Spain, that
with this stanch Toledo I will overcome your vaunted Crichton
in close fight in any manner or practice of fence or digladiation
which he may appoint--sword and dagger, or sword only--stripped
to the girdle or armed to the teeth. By our Saint
Trinidad! I will have satisfaction for the contumelious affront
he hath put upon the very learned gymnasium to which I
belong; and it would gladden me to clip the wings of this loud-crowing
cock, or any of his dunghill crew,&quot; added he, with a
scornful gesture at the Scotsman.</p>

<p>&quot;If that be all you seek, you shall not need to go far in your
quest,&quot; returned Ogilvy. &quot;Tarry till this controversy be ended,
and if I match not your Spanish blade with a Scottish broad-sword,
and approve you as recreant at heart as you are boastful
and injurious of speech, may Saint Andrew forever after withhold
from me his protection.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Devil!&quot; exclaimed the Spaniard. &quot;Thy Scottish saint
will little avail thee, since thou hast incurred my indignation.
Betake thee, therefore, to thy paternosters, if thou has grace
withal to mutter them; for within the hour thou art assuredly
food for the kites of the Pr&eacute;-aux-Clercs--sa-ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look to thyself, vile braggart!&quot; rejoined Ogilvy, scornfully:
&quot;I promise thee thou shalt need other intercession than thine
own to purchase safety at my hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Courage, Master Ogilvy,&quot; said the Englishman, &quot;thou wilt
do well to slit the ears of this Spanish swashbuckler. I warrant
me he hides a craven spirit beneath that slashed <i>pourpoint</i>.
Thou art in the right, man, to make him eat his words. Be
this Crichton what he may, he is at least thy countryman, and
in part mine own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And as such I will uphold him,&quot; said Ogilvy, &quot;against any
odds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bravo! my valorous Don Diego Caravaja,&quot; said the Sorbonist,
slapping the Spaniard on the shoulder, and speaking in his
ear. &quot;Shall these scurvy Scots carry all before them?--I warrant
me, no. We will make common cause against the whole
beggarly nation; and in the meanwhile we intrust thee with this
particular quarrel. See thou acquit thyself in it as beseemeth a
descendant of the Cid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Account him already abased,&quot; returned Caravaja. &quot;By Pelayo,
I would the other were at his back, that both might be
transfixed at a blow--ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To return to the subject of difference,&quot; said the Sorbonist,
who was too much delighted with the prospect of a duel to allow
the quarrel a chance of subsiding, while it was in his power to
fan the flame; &quot;to return to the difference,&quot; said he, aloud,
glancing at Ogilvy; &quot;it must be conceded that as a wassailer this
Crichton is without a peer. None of us may presume to cope
with him in the matter of the flask and the flagon, though we
number among us some jolly topers. Friar John, with the
Priestess of Bacbuc, was a washy bibber compared with him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He worships at the shrines of other priestesses besides hers
of Bacbuc, if I be not wrongly informed,&quot; added Montaigu, who
understood the drift of his companion.</p>

<p>&quot;Else, wherefore our rejoinder to his cartels?&quot; returned the
Sorbonist. &quot;Do you not call to mind that beneath his arrogant
defiance of our learned body, affixed to the walls of the Sorbonne,
it was written, 'That he who would behold this miracle
of learning must hie to the tavern or bordel?' Was it not so,
my hidalgo?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have myself seen him at the temulentive tavern of the
Falcon,&quot; returned Caravaja, &quot;and at the lupanarian haunts in the
Champ Gaillard and the Val-d'Amour. You understand me--ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! ha! ha!&quot; chorused the scholars. &quot;James Crichton is
no stoic. He is a disciple of Epicurus. <i>Vel in puellam impingit,
vel in poculum</i>--ha! ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis said that he hath dealings with the Evil One,&quot; observed
the man of Harcourt, with a mysterious air; &quot;and that, like
Jeanne d'Arc, he hath surrendered his soul for his temporal welfare.
Hence his wondrous lore; hence his supernatural beauty
and accomplishments; hence his power of fascinating the fair sex;
hence his constant run of luck with the dice; hence, also, his
invulnerableness to the sword.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis said, also, that he has a familiar spirit, who attends him
in the semblance of a black dog,&quot; said Montaigu.</p>

<p>&quot;Or in that of a dwarf, like the sooty imp of Cosmo Ruggieri,&quot;
said Harcourt. &quot;Is it not so?&quot; he asked, turning to the
Scot.</p>

<p>&quot;He lies in his throat who says so,&quot; cried Ogilvy, losing all
patience. &quot;To one and all of you I breathe defiance; and there
is not a brother in the college to which I belong who will not
maintain my quarrel.&quot;</p>

<p>A loud laugh of derision followed this sally; and, ashamed of
having justly exposed himself to ridicule by his idle and unworthy
display of passion, the Scotsman held his peace and endeavored
to turn a deaf ear to their taunts.</p>

<p>The gates of the College of Navarre were suddenly thrown
open, and a long-continued thunder of applause bursting from
within, announced the conclusion of the debate. That it had
terminated in favor of Crichton could no longer be doubted, as
his name formed the burden of all the plaudits with which the
courts were ringing. All was excitement: there was a general
movement. Ogilvy could no longer restrain himself. Pushing
forward by prodigious efforts, he secured himself a position at
the portal.</p>

<p>The first person who presented himself to his inquiring eyes
was a gallant figure in a glittering steel corselet crossed by a
silken sash, who bore at his side a long sword with a magnificent
handle, and upon his shoulder a lance of some six feet in length,
headed with a long scarlet tassel, and brass half-moon pendant.
&quot;Is not Crichton victorious?&quot; asked Ogilvy of Captain Larchant,
for he it was.</p>

<p>&quot;He hath acquitted himself to admiration,&quot; replied the guardsman,
who, contrary to the custom of such gentry (for captains of
the guard have been fine gentlemen in all ages), did not appear
to be displeased at this appeal to his courtesy, &quot;and the rector
hath adjudged him all the honors that can be bestowed by the
university.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hurrah for old Scotland,&quot; shouted Ogilvy, throwing his
bonnet in the air; &quot;I was sure it would be so; this is a day
worth living for. <i>Hoec olim meminisse juvabit</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thou at least shalt have reason to remember it,&quot; muttered
Caravaja, who, being opposite to him, heard the exclamation--&quot;and
he too, perchance,&quot; he added, frowning gloomily, and drawing
his cloak over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;If the noble Crichton be compatriot of yours, you are in
the right to be proud of him,&quot; replied Captain Larchant, &quot;for
the memory of his deeds of this day will live as long as learning
shall be held in reverence. Never before hath such a marvelous
display of universal erudition been heard within these
schools. By my faith, I am absolutely wonder-stricken, and not
I alone, but all. In proof of which I need only tell you, that
coupling his matchless scholarship with his extraordinary accomplishments,
the professors in their address to him at the close
of the controversy have bestowed upon him the epithet of
'Admirable'--an appellation by which he will ever after be distinguished.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Admirable Crichton!&quot; echoed Ogilvy--&quot;hear you that!--a
title adjudged to him by the whole conclave of the university--hurrah!
The Admirable Crichton! 'Tis a name will find
an echo in the heart of every true Scot. By Saint Andrew! this
is a proud day for us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the mean time,&quot; said Larchant, smiling at Ogilvy's exultations,
and describing a circle with the point of his lance, &quot;I
must trouble you to stand back, Messieurs Scholars, and leave
free passage for the rector and his train--Archers advance, and
make clear the way, and let the companies of the Baron D'Epernon
and of the Vicomte de Joyeuse be summoned, as well as the
guard of his excellency, Seigneur Ren&eacute; de Villequier. Patience,
messieurs, you will hear all particulars anon.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, he retired, and the men-at-arms, less complaisant
than their leaders, soon succeeded in forcing back the crowd.</p>

<h2><a name="MARK_AKENSIDE"></a>MARK AKENSIDE</h2>

<h3>(1721-1770)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-m.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ark Akenside is of less importance in genuine poetic rank
than in literary history. He was technically a real poet;
but he had not a great, a spontaneous, nor a fertile poetical
mind. Nevertheless, a writer who gave pleasure to a generation
cannot be set aside. The fact that the mid-eighteenth century ranked
him among its foremost poets is interesting
and still significant. It determines the
poetic standard and product of that age;
and the fact that, judged thus, Akenside
was fairly entitled to his fame.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/268.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>He was the son of a butcher, born November
9th, 1721, in Newcastle-on-Tyne,
whence Eldon and Stowell also sprang.
He attracted great attention by an early
poem, 'The Virtuoso.' The citizens of that
commercial town have always appreciated
their great men and valued intellectual distinction,
and its Dissenters sent him at
their own expense to Edinburgh to study
for the Presbyterian ministry. A year later
he gave up theology for medicine--honorably repaying the money
advanced for his divinity studies, if obviously out of some one's else
pocket.</p>

<p>After some struggle in provincial towns, his immense literary
reputation--for at twenty-four he was a star of the first magnitude
in Great Britain--and the generosity of a friend enabled him to acquire
a fashionable London practice. He wrote medical treatises
which at the time made him a leader in his profession, secured a
rich clientage, and prospered greatly. In 1759 he was made physician
to Christ's Hospital, where, however valued professionally, he is
charged with being brutal and offensive to the poor; with indulging
his fastidiousness, temper, and pomposity, and with forgetting that
he owed anything to mere duty or humanity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, too, Akenside availed himself of that mixture of
complaisance and arrogance by which almost alone a man of no birth
can rise in a society graded by birth. He concealed his origin and
was ashamed of his pedigree. But the blame for his flunkeyism
belongs, perhaps, less to him than to the insolent caste feeling of
society, which forced it on him as a measure of self-defense and of
advancement. He wanted money, loved place and selfish comfort,
and his nature did not balk at the means of getting them,--including
living on a friend when he did not need such help. To become
physician to the Queen, he turned his coat from Whig to Tory; but
no one familiar with the politics of the time will regard this as an
unusual offense. It must also be remembered that Akenside possessed
a delicate constitution, keen senses, and irritable nerves; and
that he was a parvenu, lacking the power of self-control even among
strangers. These traits explain, though they do not excuse, his bad
temper to the unclean and disagreeable patients of the hospital, and
they mitigate the fact that his industry was paralyzed by material
prosperity, and his self-culture interfered with by conceit. His early
and sweeping success injured him as many a greater man has been
thus injured.</p>

<p>Moreover, his temper was probably soured by secret bitternesses.
His health, his nerves, an entire absence of the sense of humor, and
his lack of repartee, made him shun like Pope and Horace Walpole
the bibulous and gluttonous element of eighteenth-century British
society. For its brutal horseplay and uncivil practical joking which
passed for wit, Akenside had no tolerance, yet he felt unwilling to
go where he would be outshone by inferior men. His strutty arrogance
of manner, like excessive prudery in a woman, may have been
a fortification to a garrison too weak to fight in the open field. And
it must be admitted that, as so often happens, Akenside's outward
<i>ensemble</i> was eminently what the vulgar world terms &quot;guyable.&quot; He
was not a little of a fop. He was plain-featured and yet assuming
in manner. He hobbled in walking from lameness of tell-tale origin,--a
cleaver falling on his foot in childhood, compelling him to wear
an artificial heel--and he was morbidly sensitive over it. His prim
formality of manner, his sword and stiff-curled wig, his small and
sickly face trying to maintain an expression impressively dignified,
made him a ludicrous figure, which his contemporaries never tired
of ridiculing and caricaturing. Henderson, the actor, said that &quot;Akenside,
when he walked the streets, looked for all the world like one
of his own Alexandrines set upright.&quot; Smollett even used him as
a model for the pedantic doctor in 'Peregrine Pickle,' who gives a
dinner in the fashion of the ancients, and dresses each dish according
to humorous literary recipes.</p>

<p>But there were those who seem to have known an inner and superior
personality beneath the brusqueness, conceit, and policy, beyond
the nerves and fears; and they valued it greatly, at least on the
intellectual side. A wealthy and amiable young Londoner, Jeremiah
Dyson, remained a friend so enduring and admiring as to give the
poet a house in Bloomsbury Square, with &pound;300 a year and a chariot,
and personally to extend his medical practice. We cannot suppose
this to be a case of patron and parasite. Other men of judgment
showed like esteem. And in congenial society, Akenside was his best
and therefore truest self. He was an easy and even brilliant talker,
displaying learning and immense memory, taste, and philosophic reflection;
and as a volunteer critic he has the unique distinction of a
man who had what books he liked given him by the publishers for
the sake of his oral comments!</p>

<p>The standard edition of Akenside's poems is that edited by Alexander
Dyce (London, 1835). Few of them require notice here. His
early effort, 'The Virtuoso,' was merely an acknowledged and servile
imitation of Spenser. The claim made by the poet's biographers
that he preceded Thomson in reintroducing the Spenserian stanza is
groundless. Pope preceded him, and Thomson renewed its popularity
by being the first to use it in a poem of real merit, 'The
Castle of Indolence.' Mr. Gosse calls the 'Hymn to the Naiads'
&quot;beautiful,&quot;--&quot;of transcendent merit,&quot;--&quot;perhaps the most elegant
of his productions.&quot; The 'Epistle to Curio,' however, must be held
his best poem,--doubtless because it is the only one which came
from his heart; and even its merit is much more in rhetorical energy
than in art or beauty. As to its allusion and object, the real and
classic Curio of Roman social history was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Cicero's, a rich
young Senator, who began as a champion of liberty and then sold
himself to Caesar to pay his debts. In Akenside's poem, Curio represents
William Pulteney, Walpole's antagonist, the hope of that younger
generation who hated Walpole's system of parliamentary corruption
and official jobbing. This party had looked to Pulteney for a clean
and public-spirited administration. Their hero was carried to a brief
triumph on the wave of their enthusiasm. But Pulteney disappointed
them bitterly: he took a peerage, and sunk into utter and permanent
political damnation, with no choice but Walpole's methods and
tools, no policy save Walpole's to redeem the withdrawal of so much
lofty promise, and no aims but personal advancement. From Akenside's
address to him, the famous 'Epistle to Curio,' a citation is
made below. Akenside's fame, however, rests on the 'Pleasures of
the Imagination.' He began it at seventeen; though in the case of
works begun in childhood, it is safer to accept the date of finishing
as the year of the real composition. He published it six years later,
in 1744, on the advice and with the warm admiration of Pope, a man
never wasteful of encomiums on the poetry of his contemporaries. It
raised its author to immediate fame. It secures him a place among
the accepted English classics still. Yet neither its thought nor its
style makes the omission to read it any irreparable loss. It is cultivated
rhetoric rather than true poetry. Its chief merit and highest
usefulness are that it suggested two far superior poems, Campbell's
'Pleasures of Hope' and Rogers's 'Pleasures of Memory.' It is the
relationship to these that really keeps Akenside's alive.</p>

<p>In scope, the poem consists of two thousand lines of blank verse.
It is distributed in three books. The first defines the sources, methods,
and results of imagination; the second its distinction from philosophy
and its enchantment by the passions; the third sets forth
the power of imagination to give pleasure, and illustrates its mental
operation. The author remodeled the poem in 1757, but it is generally
agreed that he injured it. Macaulay says he spoiled it, and
another critic delightfully observes that he &quot;stuffed it with intellectual
horsehair.&quot;</p>

<p>The year of Akenside's death (1770) gave birth to Wordsworth.
The freer and nobler natural school of poetry came to supplant the
artificial one, belonging to an epoch of wigs and false calves, and to
open toward the far greater one of the romanticism of Scott and
Byron.</p>

[With this earlier and finer form of Akenside's address to the unstable
Pulteney (see biographical sketch above) must not be confused its later
embodiment among his odes; of which it is 'IX: to Curio.' Much of its
thought and diction were transferred to the Ode named; but the latter by no
means happily compares with the original 'Epistle.' Both versions, however,
are of the same year, 1744.]<br><br>

Thrice has the spring beheld thy faded fame,<br>
And the fourth winter rises on thy shame,<br>
Since I exulting grasped the votive shell.<br>
In sounds of triumph all thy praise to tell;<br>
Blest could my skill through ages make thee shine,<br>
And proud to mix my memory with thine.<br>
But now the cause that waked my song before,<br>
With praise, with triumph, crowns the toil no more.<br>
If to the glorious man whose faithful cares,<br>
Nor quelled by malice, nor relaxed by years,<br>
Had awed Ambition's wild audacious hate,<br>
And dragged at length Corruption to her fate;<br>
If every tongue its large applauses owed,<br>
And well-earned laurels every muse bestowed;<br>
If public Justice urged the high reward,<br>
And Freedom smiled on the devoted bard:<br>
Say then,--to him whose levity or lust<br>
Laid all a people's generous hopes in dust,<br>
Who taught Ambition firmer heights of power<br>
And saved Corruption at her hopeless hour,<br>
Does not each tongue its execrations owe?<br>
Shall not each Muse a wreath of shame bestow?<br>
And public Justice sanctify the award?<br>
And Freedom's hand protect the impartial bard?<br>
<br>
There are who say they viewed without amaze<br>
The sad reverse of all thy former praise;<br>
That through the pageants of a patriot's name,<br>
They pierced the foulness of thy secret aim;<br>
Or deemed thy arm exalted but to throw<br>
The public thunder on a private foe.<br>
But I, whose soul consented to thy cause,<br>
Who felt thy genius stamp its own applause,<br>
Who saw the spirits of each glorious age<br>
Move in thy bosom, and direct thy rage,--<br>
I scorned the ungenerous gloss of slavish minds,<br>
The owl-eyed race, whom Virtue's lustre blinds.<br>
Spite of the learned in the ways of vice,<br>
And all who prove that each man has his price,<br>
I still believed thy end was just and free;<br>
And yet, even yet believe it--spite of thee.<br>
Even though thy mouth impure has dared disclaim,<br>
Urged by the wretched impotence of shame,<br>
Whatever filial cares thy zeal had paid<br>
To laws infirm, and liberty decayed;<br>
Has begged Ambition to forgive the show;<br>
Has told Corruption thou wert ne'er her foe;<br>
Has boasted in thy country's awful ear,<br>
Her gross delusion when she held thee dear;<br>
How tame she followed thy tempestuous call,<br>
And heard thy pompous tales, and trusted all--<br>
Rise from your sad abodes, ye curst of old<br>
For laws subverted, and for cities sold!<br>
Paint all the noblest trophies of your guilt,<br>
The oaths you perjured, and the blood you spilt;<br>
Yet must you one untempted vileness own,<br>
One dreadful palm reserved for him alone:<br>
With studied arts his country's praise to spurn,<br>
To beg the infamy he did not earn,<br>
To challenge hate when honor was his due,<br>
And plead his crimes where all his virtue knew.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;"><br>
When they who, loud for liberty and laws,<br>
In doubtful times had fought their country's cause,<br>
When now of conquest and dominion sure,<br>
They sought alone to hold their fruit secure;<br>
When taught by these, Oppression hid the face,<br>
To leave Corruption stronger in her place,<br>
By silent spells to work the public fate,<br>
And taint the vitals of the passive state,<br>
Till healing Wisdom should avail no more,<br>
And Freedom loath to tread the poisoned shore:<br>
Then, like some guardian god that flies to save<br>
The weary pilgrim from an instant grave,<br>
Whom, sleeping and secure, the guileful snake<br>
Steals near and nearer thro' the peaceful brake,--<br>
Then Curio rose to ward the public woe,<br>
To wake the heedless and incite the slow,<br>
Against Corruption Liberty to arm.<br>
And quell the enchantress by a mightier charm.<br>
<br>

Lo! the deciding hour at last appears;<br>
The hour of every freeman's hopes and fears!<br>

To mark the windings of a scanty rill<br>

Disdains to rest her heaven-aspiring wing<br>
Beneath its native quarry. Tired of earth<br>

Through fields of air; pursues the flying storm;<br>
Rides on the volleyed lightning through the heavens;<br>
Or, yoked with whirlwinds and the northern blast,<br>
Sweeps the long tract of day. Then high she soars<br>
The blue profound, and, hovering round the sun,<br>
Beholds him pouring the redundant stream<br>
Of light; beholds his unrelenting sway<br>

Rest at the fated goal. For from the birth<br>

<p>his novelist, poet, and politician was born at Guadix, in Spain,
near Granada, March 10th, 1833, and received his early training
in the seminary of his native city. His family destined
him for the Church; but he was averse to that profession, subsequently
studied law and modern languages at the University of
Granada, and took pains to cultivate his natural love for literature
and poetry. In 1853 he established at Cadiz the literary review Eco
del Occidente (Echo of the West). Greatly interested in politics, he
joined a democratic club with headquarters at Madrid. During the
revolution of 1854 he published El L&aacute;tigo (The Whip), a pamphlet in
which he satirized the government. The spirit of adventure being
always strong in him, he joined the African campaign under O'Donnell
in 1859.</p>

<p>His next occupation was the editorship of the journals La Epoca
and La Politica. Condemned to a brief period of exile as one of the
signers of a protest of Unionist deputies, he passed this time in
Paris. Shortly after his return he became involved in the revolution
of 1868, but without incurring personal disaster. After Alfonso XII.
came to the throne in 1875, he was appointed Councilor of State.</p>

<p>It was in the domain of letters, however, and more especially as a
novelist, that he won his most enduring laurels. In 1855 he produced
'EL Final de Norma' (The End of Norma), which was his first
romance of importance. Four years later he began to publish that
series of notable novels which brought him fame, both at home and
abroad. The list includes 'EL Sombrero de Tres Picos' (The Three-Cornered
Hat), a charming <i>genre</i> sketch famous for its pungent wit
and humor, and its clever portraiture of provincial life in Spain at
the beginning of this century; 'La Alpujarra'; 'EL Esc&aacute;ndalo' (The
Scandal), a story which at once created a profound sensation because
of its ultramontane cast and opposition to prevalent scientific opinion;
'El Ni&ntilde;o de la Bola' (The Child of the Ball), thought by many to be
his masterpiece; 'El Capit&aacute;n Veneno' (Captain Veneno); 'Novelas
Cortas' (Short Stories), 3 vols.; and 'La Pr&oacute;diga' (The Prodigal).
Alarc&oacute;n is also favorably known as poet, dramatic critic, and an
incisive and effective writer of general prose.</p>

<p>His other publications comprise:--'Diario de un Testigo de la
Guerra de Africa' (Journal of a Witness of the African War), a work
which is said to have netted the publishers a profit of three million
pesetas ($600,000); 'De Madrid &agrave; N&aacute;poles' (from Madrid to Naples);
'Poesias Serias y Humor&iacute;sticas' (Serious and Humorous Poems);
'Judicios Liter&aacute;rios y Art&iacute;sticos' (Literary and Artistic Critiques);
'Viages por Espa&ntilde;a' (Travels through Spain); 'El Hijo Pr&oacute;digo'
(The Prodigal Son), a drama for children; and 'Ultimos Escritos'
(Last Writings). Alarc&oacute;n was elected a member of the Spanish
Academy December 15th, 1875. Many of his novels have been translated
into English and French. He died July 20th, 1891.</p>

<h3><a name="A_WOMAN_VIEWED_FROM_WITHOUT"></a>A WOMAN VIEWED FROM WITHOUT</h3>
<center>From 'The Three-Cornered Hat'</center>

<p>The last and perhaps the most powerful reason which the
quality of the city--clergy as well as laymen, beginning
with the bishop and the corregidor--had for visiting the
mill so often in the afternoon, was to admire there at leisure one
of the most beautiful, graceful, and admirable works that ever
left the hands of the Creator: called Se&ntilde;a [Mrs.] Frasquita. Let
us begin by assuring you that Se&ntilde;a Frasquita was the lawful
spouse of Uncle Luke, and an honest woman; of which fact all
the illustrious visitors of the mill were well aware. Indeed, none
of them ever seemed to gaze on her with sinful eyes or doubtful
purpose. They all admired her, indeed, and sometimes paid her
compliments,--the friars as well as the cavaliers, the prebendaries
as well as the magistrate,--as a prodigy of beauty, an
honor to her Creator, and as a coquettish and mischievous sprite,
who innocently enlivened the most melancholy of spirits. &quot;She
is a handsome creature,&quot; the most virtuous prelate used to say.
&quot;She looks like an ancient Greek statue,&quot; remarked a learned
advocate, who was an Academician and corresponding member on
history. &quot;She is the very image of Eve,&quot; broke forth the prior
of the Franciscans. &quot;She is a fine woman,&quot; exclaimed the colonel
of militia. &quot;She is a serpent, a witch, a siren, an imp,&quot; added the
corregidor. &quot;But she is a good woman, an angel, a lovely creature,
and as innocent as a child four years old,&quot; all agreed in
saying on leaving the mill, crammed with grapes or nuts, on their
way to their dull and methodical homes.</p>

<p>This four-year-old child, that is to say, Frasquita, was nearly
thirty years old, and almost six feet high, strongly built in proportion,
and even a little stouter than exactly corresponded to her
majestic figure. She looked like a gigantic Niobe, though she
never had any children; she seemed like a female Hercules, or
like a Roman matron, the sort of whom there are still copies to
be seen in the Rioni Trastevere. But the most striking feature
was her mobility, her agility, her animation, and the grace of her
rather large person.</p>

<p>For resemblance to a statue, to which the Academician compared
her, she lacked statuesque repose. She bent her body like
a reed, or spun around like a weather-vane, or danced like a top.
Her features possessed even greater mobility, and in consequence
were even less statuesque. They were lighted up beautifully by
five dimples: two on one cheek, one on the other, another very
small one near the left side of her roguish lips, and the last--and
a very big one--in the cleft of her rounded chin. Add to
these charms her sly or roguish glances, her pretty pouts, and the
various attitudes of her head, with which she emphasized her
talk, and you will have some idea of that face full of vivacity
and beauty, and always radiant with health and happiness.</p>

<p>Neither Uncle Luke nor Se&ntilde;a Frasquita was Andalusian by
birth: she came from Navarre, and he from Murcia. He went
to the city of ---- when he was but fifteen years old, as half
page, half servant of the bishop, the predecessor of the present
incumbent of that diocese. He was brought up for the Church
by his patron, who, perhaps on that account, so that he might
not lack competent maintenance, bequeathed him the mill in his
will. But Uncle Luke, who had received only the lesser orders
when the bishop died, cast off his ecclesiastical garb at once and
enlisted as a soldier; for he felt more anxious to see the world
and to lead a life of adventure than to say mass or grind corn.
He went through the campaign of the Western Provinces in
1793, as the orderly of the brave General Ventura Caro; he was
present at the siege of the Castle of Pi&ntilde;on, and remained a long
time in the Northern Provinces, when he finally quitted the service.
In Estella he became acquainted with Se&ntilde;a Frasquita, who
was then simply called Frasquita; made love to her, married
her, and carried her to Andalusia to take possession of the mill,
where they were to live so peaceful and happy during the rest
of their pilgrimage through this vale of tears.</p>

<p>When Frasquita was taken from Navarre to that lonely place
she had not yet acquired any Andalusian ways, and was very
different from the countrywomen in that vicinity. She dressed
with greater simplicity, greater freedom, grace, and elegance
than they did. She bathed herself oftener; and allowed the sun
and air to caress her bare arms and uncovered neck. To a certain
extent she wore the style of dress worn by the gentlewomen
of that period; like that of the women in Goya's pictures, and
somewhat of the fashion worn by Queen Maria Louisa: if not
exactly so scant, yet so short that it showed her small feet, and
the commencement of her superb limbs; her bodice was low,
and round in the neck, according to the style in Madrid, where
she spent two months with her Luke on their way from Navarre
to Andalusia. She dressed her hair high on the top of her head,
displaying thus both the graceful curve of her snowy neck and
the shape of her pretty head. She wore earrings in her small
ears, and the taper fingers of her rough but clean hands were
covered with rings. Lastly, Frasquita's voice was as sweet as a
flute, and her laugh was so merry and so silvery it seemed like
the ringing of bells on Saturday of Glory or Easter Eve.</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="HOW_THE_ORPHAN_MANUEL_GAINED_HIS_SOBRIQUET"></a>HOW THE ORPHAN MANUEL GAINED HIS SOBRIQUET</h3>
<center>From 'The Child of the Ball'</center>

<p>The unfortunate boy seemed to have turned to ice from the
cruel and unexpected blows of fate; he contracted a death-like
pallor, which he never again lost. No one paid any
attention to the unhappy child in the first moments of his
anguish, or noticed that he neither groaned, sighed, nor wept.
When at last they went to him they found him convulsed and
rigid, like a petrifaction of grief; although he walked about,
heard and saw, and covered his wounded and dying father with
kisses. But he shed not a single tear, either during the death
agony of that beloved being, when he kissed the cold face after
it was dead, or when he saw them carry the body away forever;
nor when he left the house in which he had been born, and
found himself sheltered by charity in the house of a stranger.
Some praised his courage, others criticized his callousness.
Mothers pitied him profoundly, instinctively divining the cruel
tragedy that was being enacted in the orphan's heart for want
of some tender and compassionate being to make him weep by
weeping with him.</p>

<p>Nor did Manuel utter a single word from the moment he
saw his beloved father brought in dying. He made no answer
to the affectionate questions asked him by Don Trinidad after the
latter had taken him home; and the sound of his voice was never
heard during the first three years which he spent in the holy
company of the priest. Everybody thought by this time that
he would remain dumb forever, when one day, in the church of
which his protector was the priest, the sacristan observed him
standing before a beautiful image of the &quot;Child of the Ball,&quot;
and heard him saying in melancholy accents:--</p>

<p>&quot;Child Jesus, why do you not speak either?&quot;</p>

<p>Manuel was saved. The drowning boy had raised his head
above the engulfing waters of his grief. His life was no longer
in danger. So at least it was believed in the parish.</p>

<p>Toward strangers--from whom, whenever they came in contact
with him, he always received demonstrations of pity and
kindness--the orphan continued to maintain the same glacial
reserve as before, rebuffing them with the phrase, stereotyped on
his disdainful lips, &quot;Let me alone, now;&quot; having said which, in
tones of moving entreaty, he would go on his way, not without
awakening superstitious feelings in the minds of the persons
whom he thus shunned.</p>

<p>Still less did he lay aside, at this saving crisis, the profound
sadness and precocious austerity of his character, or the obstinate
persistence with which he clung to certain habits. These were
limited, thus far, to accompanying the priest to the church;
gathering flowers or aromatic herbs to adorn the image of the
&quot;Child of the Ball,&quot; before which he would spend hour after
hour, plunged in a species of ecstasy; and climbing the neighboring
mountain in search of those herbs and flowers, when, owing
to the severity of the heat or cold, they were not to be found in
the fields.</p>

<p>This adoration, while in consonance with the religious principles
instilled into him from the cradle by his father, greatly
exceeded what is usual even in the most devout. It was a
fraternal and submissive love, like that which he had entertained
for his father; it was a confused mixture of familiarity, protection,
and idolatry, very similar to the feeling which the
mothers of men of genius entertain for their illustrious sons; it
was the respectful and protecting tenderness which the strong
warrior bestows on the youthful prince; it was an identification
of himself with the image; it was pride; it was elation as for a
personal good. It seemed as if this image symbolized for him
his tragic fate, his noble origin, his early orphanhood, his poverty,
his cares, the injustice of men, his solitary state in the world,
and perhaps too some presentiment of his future sufferings.</p>

<p>Probably nothing of all this was clear at the time to the mind
of the hapless boy, but something resembling it must have been
the tumult of confused thoughts that palpitated in the depths of
that childlike, unwavering, absolute, and exclusive devotion. For
him there was neither God nor the Virgin, neither saints nor
angels; there was only the &quot;Child of the Ball,&quot; not with relation
to any profound mystery, but in himself, in his present form,
with his artistic figure, his dress of gold tissue, his crown of
false stones, his blonde head, his charming countenance, and the
blue-painted globe which he held in his hand, and which was
surmounted by a little silver-gilt cross, in sign of the redemption
of the world.</p>

<p>And this was the cause and reason why the acolytes of Santa
Mar&iacute;a de la Cab&eacute;za first, all the boys of the town afterward, and
finally the more respectable and sedate persons, bestowed on
Manuel the extraordinary name of &quot;The Child of the Ball&quot;: we
know not whether by way of applause of such vehement idolatry,
and to commit him, as it were, to the protection of the Christ-Child
himself; or as a sarcastic antiphrasis,--seeing that this
appellation is sometimes used in the place as a term of comparison
for the happiness of the very fortunate; or as a prophecy
of the valor for which the son of Venegas was to be one day
celebrated, and the terror he was to inspire,--since the most
hyperbolical expression that can be employed in that district, to
extol the bravery and power of any one, is to say that &quot;she does
not fear even the 'Child of the Ball.'&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="ALCAEUS"></a>ALCAEUS</h2>

<h3>(Sixth Century B.C.)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>lcaeus, a contemporary of the more famous poet whom he
addressed as &quot;violet-crowned, pure, sweetly-smiling Sappho,&quot;
was a native of Mitylene in Lesbos. His period of work
fell probably between 610 and 580 B.C. At this time his native
town was disturbed by an unceasing contention for power between
the aristocracy and the people; and Alcaeus,
through the vehemence of his zeal
and his ambition, was among the leaders
of the warring faction. By the accidents
of birth and education he was an aristocrat,
and in politics he was what is now
called a High Tory. With his brothers,
Cicis and Antimenidas, two influential
young nobles as arrogant and haughty
as himself, he resented and opposed the
slightest concession to democracy. He
was a stout soldier, but he threw away
his arms at Ligetum when he saw that
his side was beaten, and afterward wrote
a poem on this performance, apparently not in the least mortified by
the recollection. Horace speaks of the matter, and laughingly confesses
his own like misadventure.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/284.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>When the kindly Pittacus was chosen dictator, he was compelled
to banish the swashbuckling brothers for their abuse of him. But
when Alcaeus chanced to be taken prisoner, Pittacus set him free,
remarking that &quot;forgiveness is better than revenge.&quot; The irreconcilable
poet spent his exile in Egypt, and there he may have seen
the Greek oligarch who lent his sword to Nebuchadnezzar, and whom
he greeted in a poem, a surviving fragment of which is thus paraphrased
by John Addington Symonds:--</p>

<blockquote>
From the ends of the earth thou art come,<br>
Back to thy home;<br>
The ivory hilt of thy blade<br>
With gold is embossed and inlaid;<br>
Since for Babylon's host a great deed<br>
Thou didst work in their need,<br>
Slaying a warrior, an athlete of might,<br>
Royal, whose height<br>
Lacked of five cubits one span--<br>
A terrible man.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Alcaeus is reputed to have been in love with Sappho, the glorious,
but only a line or two survives to confirm the tale. Most of his
lyrics, like those of his fellow-poets, seem to have been drinking
songs, combined, says Symonds, with reflections upon life, and
appropriate descriptions of the different seasons. &quot;No time was
amiss for drinking, to his mind: the heat of summer, the cold of
winter, the blazing dog-star and the driving tempest, twilight with
its cheerful gleam of lamps, mid-day with its sunshine--all suggest
reasons for indulging in the cup. Not that we are justified in
fancying Alcaeus a mere vulgar toper: he retained Aeolian sumptuousness
in his pleasures, and raised the art of drinking to an aesthetic
attitude.&quot;</p>

<p>Alcaeus composed in the Aeolic dialect; for the reason, it is said,
that it was more familiar to his hearers. After his death his poems
were collected and divided into ten books. Bergk has included the
fragments--and one of his compositions has come down to us entire--his
'Poetae Lyrici Graeci.'</p>

<p>His love of political strife and military glory led him to the
composition of a class of poems which the ancients called 'Stasiotica'
(Songs of Sedition). To this class belong his descriptions of the
furnishing of his palace, and many of the fragments preserved to us.
Besides those martial poems, he composed hymns to the gods, and
love and convivial songs.</p>

<p>His verses are subjective and impassioned. They are outbursts of
the poet's own feeling, his own peculiar expression toward the world
in which he lived; and it is this quality that gave them their
strength and their celebrity. His metres were lively, and the care
which he expended upon his strophes has led to the naming of one
metre the 'Alcaic.' Horace testifies (Odes ii. 13, ii. 26, etc.), to the
power of his master.</p>

<p>The first selection following is a fragment from his 'Stasiotica.'
It is a description of the splendor of his palace before &quot;the work
of war began.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="BALTAZAR_DE_ALCAZAR"></a>BALT&Aacute;ZAR DE ALC&Aacute;ZAR</h2>

<h3>(1530?-1606)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>lthough little may be realized now of Alc&aacute;zar's shadowy personality,
there is no doubt that in his own century he was
widely read. Born of a very respectable family in Seville,
either in 1530 or 1531, he first appears as entering the Spanish navy,
and participating in several battles on the war galleys of the Marquis
of Santa Cruz. It is known that for about twenty years he
was alcalde or mayor at the Molares on the outskirts of Utrera,--an
important local functionary, a practical man interested in public
affairs.</p>

<p>But, on the whole, his seems to have been a strongly artistic
nature; for he was a musician of repute, skillful too at painting, and
above all a poet. As master and model in metrical composition he
chose Martial, and in his epigrammatic turn he is akin to the great
Latin poet. He was fond of experimenting in Latin lyrical forms,
and wrote many madrigals and sonnets. They are full of vigorous
thought and bright satire, of playful malice and epicurean joy in life,
and have always won the admiration of his fellow-poets. As has
been said, they show a fine taste, quite in advance of the age.
Cervantes, his greater contemporary, acknowledged his power with

<h2><a name="ALCIPHRON"></a>ALCIPHRON</h2>

<h3>(Second Century A.D.)</h3>

<h3>BY HARRY THURSTON PECK</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-i.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>n the history of Greek prose fiction the possibilities of the
epistolary form were first developed by the Athenian teacher
of rhetoric, Alciphron, of whose life and personality nothing
is known except that he lived in the second century A.D.,--a
contemporary of the great satirical genius Lucian. Of his writings
we now possess only a collection of imaginary letters, one hundred
and eighteen in number, arranged in three books. Their value
depends partly upon the curious and interesting pictures given in
them of the life of the post-Alexandrine period, especially of the
low life, and partly upon the fact that they are the first successful
attempts at character-drawing to be found in the history of Greek
prose fiction. They form a connecting link between the novel of
pure incident and adventure, and the more fully developed novel
which combines incident and adventure with the delineation of character
and the study of motive. The use of the epistolary form in
fictitious composition did not, to be sure, originate with Alciphron;
for we find earlier instances in the imaginary love-letters composed
in verse by the Roman poet, Ovid, under the names of famous
women of early legend, such as those of Oenone to Paris (which
suggested a beautiful poem of Tennyson's), Medea to Jason, and
many others. In these one finds keen insight into character, especially
feminine character, together with much that is exquisite in
fancy and tender in expression. But it is to Alciphron that we owe
the adaptation of this form of composition to prose fiction, and its
employment in a far wider range of psychological and social observation.</p>

<p>The life whose details are given us by Alciphron is the life of
contemporary Athens in the persons of its easy-going population.
The writers whose letters we are supposed to read in reading
Alciphron are peasants, fishermen, parasites, men-about-town, and
courtesans. The language of the letters is neat, pointed, and appropriate
to the person who in each case is supposed to be the writer;
and the details are managed with considerable art. Alciphron effaces
all impression of his own personality, and is lost in the characters
who for the time being occupy his pages. One reads the letters as
he would read a genuine correspondence. The illusion is perfect,
and we feel that we are for the moment in the Athens of the third
century before Christ; that we are strolling in its streets, visiting its
shops, its courts, and its temples, and that we are getting a whiff of
the Aegean, mingled with the less savory odors of the markets and
of the wine-shops. We stroll about the city elbowing our way
through the throng of boatmen, merchants, and hucksters. Here a
barber stands outside his shop and solicits custom; there an old
usurer with pimply face sits bending over his accounts in a dingy
little office; at the corner of the street a crowd encircles some Cheap
Jack who is showing off his juggling tricks at a small three-legged
table, making sea-shells vanish out of sight and then taking them
from his mouth. Drunken soldiers pass and repass, talking boisterously
of their bouts and brawls, of their drills and punishments,
and the latest news of their barracks, and forming a striking contrast
to the philosopher, who, in coarse robes, moves with supercilious
look and an affectation of deep thought, in silence amid the crowd
that jostles him. The scene is vivid, striking, realistic.</p>

<p>Many of the letters are from women; and in these, especially,
Alciphron reveals the daily life of the Athenians. We see the demimonde
at their toilet, with their mirrors, their powders, their
enamels and rouge-pots, their brushes and pincers, and all the
thousand and one accessories. Acquaintances come in to make a
morning call, and we hear their chatter,--Tha&iuml;s and Megara and
Bacchis, Hermione and Myrrha. They nibble cakes, drink sweet
wine, gossip about their respective lovers, hum the latest songs,
and enjoy themselves with perfect abandon. Again we see them
at their evening rendezvous, at the banquets where philosophers,
poets, sophists, painters, artists of every sort,--in fact, the whole
Bohemia of Athens,--gather round them. We get hints of all the
stages of the revel, from the sparkling wit and the jolly good-fellowship
of the early evening, to the sodden disgust that comes
with daybreak when the lamps are poisoning the fetid air and the
remnants of the feast are stale.</p>

<p>We are not to look upon the letters of Alciphron as embodying a
literary unity. He did not attempt to write one single symmetrical
epistolary romance; but the individual letters are usually slight
sketches of character carelessly gathered together, and deriving
their greatest charm from their apparent spontaneity and artlessness.
Many of them are, to be sure, unpleasantly cynical, and depict the
baser side of human nature; others, in their realism, are essentially
commonplace; but some are very prettily expressed, and show a
brighter side to the picture of contemporary life. Those especially
which are supposed to pass between Menander, the famous comic
poet, and his mistress Glycera, form a pleasing contrast to the greed
and cynicism of much that one finds in the first book of the epistles;
they are true love-letters, and are untainted by the slightest suggestion
of the mercenary spirit or the veiled coarseness that makes
so many of the others unpleasant reading. One letter (i. 6) is
interesting as containing the first allusion found in literature to the
familiar story of Phryne before the judges, which is more fully told
in Athenaeus.</p>

<p>The imaginary letter was destined to play an important part in
the subsequent history of literature. Alciphron was copied by
Aristaenetus, who lived in the fifth century of our era, and whose
letters have been often imitated in modern times, and by Theophylactus,
who lived in the seventh century. In modern English fiction
the epistolary form has been most successfully employed by Richardson,
Fanny Burney, and, in another <i>genre</i>, by Wilkie Collins.</p>

<p>The standard editions of Alciphron are those of Seiler (Leipzig,
1856) and of Hercher (Paris, 1873), the latter containing the Greek
text with a parallel version in Latin. The letters have not yet been
translated into English. The reader may refer to the chapter on
Alciphron in the recently published work of Salverte, 'Le Roman
dans la Gr&egrave;ce Ancienne' (The Novel in Ancient Greece: Paris,
1893). The following selections are translated by the present writer.</p>

<p>Well, if a girl could live on tears, what a wealthy girl I
should be; for you are generous enough with <i>them</i>, any-how!
Unfortunately, however, that isn't quite enough
for me. I need money; I must have jewels, clothes, servants,
and all that sort of thing. Nobody has left me a fortune, I
should like you to know, or any mining stock; and so I am
obliged to depend on the little presents that gentlemen happen
to make me. Now that I've known you a year, how much better
off am I for it, I should like to ask? My head looks like a
fright because I haven't had anything to rig it out with, all that
time; and as to clothes,--why, the only dress I've got in the
world is in rags that make me ashamed to be seen with my
friends: and yet you imagine that I can go on in this way without
having any other means of living! Oh, yes, of course, you
cry; but you'll stop presently. I'm really surprised at the number
of your tears; but really, unless somebody gives me something
pretty soon I shall die of starvation. Of course, you
pretend you're just crazy for me, and that you can't live without
me. Well, then, isn't there any family silver in your house?
Hasn't your mother any jewelry that you can get hold of?
Hasn't your father any valuables? Other girls are luckier than
I am; for I have a mourner rather than a lover. He sends me
crowns, and he sends me garlands and roses, as if I were dead
and buried before my time, and he says that he cries all night.
Now, if you can manage to scrape up something for me, you can
come here without having to cry your eyes out; but if you can't,
why, keep your tears to yourself, and don't bother me!</p>

<p>By all the gods and demons, I beg you, dear mother, to leave
your rocks and fields in the country, and before you die,
discover what beautiful things there are in town. Just think
what you are losing,--the Haloan Festival and the Apaturian
Festival, and the Great Festival of Bacchus, and especially the
Thesmophorian Festival, which is now going on. If you would
only hurry up, and get here to-morrow morning before it is daylight,
you would be able to take part in the affair with the other
Athenian women. Do come, and don't put it off, if you have
any regard for my happiness and my brothers'; for it's an awful
thing to die without having any knowledge of the city. That's
the life of an ox; and one that is altogether unreasonable. Please
excuse me, mother, for speaking so freely for your own good.
After all, one ought to speak plainly with everybody, and especially
with those who are themselves plain speakers.</p>

offer ivy and laurel and myrtle and flowers to the gods at

and wine and a milk-pail full of the new goat's-milk. But as
things are, you despise the country and farming, and are fond
only of the helmet-plumes and the shield, just as if you were an
Acarnanian or a Malian soldier. Don't keep on in this way, my
son; but come back to us and take up this peaceful life of ours
again (for farming is perfectly safe and free from any danger,
and doesn't require bands of soldiers and strategy and squadrons),
and be the stay of our old age, preferring a safe life to a
risky one.</p>

to learn about the other points in which a city differs from
the country. Consequently, if you have any reason for going to
town, do come and take me with you. As a matter of fact, I am
sure there are lots of things I ought to know, now that my beard
is beginning to sprout; and who is so able to show me the city
as yourself, who are all the time going back and forth to the
town?</p>

<p>I should like to ask my evil genius, who drew me by lot as his
own particular charge, why he is so malignant and so cruel
as to keep me in everlasting poverty; for if no one happens
to invite me to dinner I have to live on greens, and to eat acorns
and to fill my stomach with water from the hydrant. Now, as
long as my body was able to put up with this sort of thing, and
my time of life was such as made it proper for me to bear it, I
could get along with them fairly well; but now that my hair is
growing gray, and the only outlook I have is in the direction of
old age, what on earth am I going to do? I shall really have to
get a rope and hang myself unless my luck changes. However,
even if fortune remains as it is, I shan't string myself up before
I have at least one square meal; for before very long, the wedding
of Charitus and Leocritis, which is going to be a famous
affair, will come off, to which there isn't a doubt that I shall be
invited,--either to the wedding itself or to the banquet afterward.
It's lucky that weddings need the jokes of brisk fellows
like myself, and that without us they would be as dull as gatherings
of pigs rather than of human beings!</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to know why I am complaining so,
and how I got my head broken, and why I'm going around
with my clothes in tatters. The fact is I swept the board at
gambling: but I wish I hadn't; for what's the sense in a feeble
fellow like me running up against a lot of stout young men?
You see, after I scooped in all the money they put up, and they
hadn't a cent left, they all jumped on my neck, and some of
them punched me, and some of them stoned me, and some of
them tore my clothes off my back. All the same, I hung on to
the money as hard as I could, because I would rather die than
give up anything of theirs I had got hold of; and so I held out
bravely for quite a while, not giving in when they struck me, or
even when they bent my fingers back. In fact, I was like some
Spartan who lets himself be whipped as a test of his endurance:
but unfortunately it wasn't at Sparta that I was doing this thing,
but at Athens, and with the toughest sort of an Athenian gambling
crowd; and so at last, when actually fainting, I had to let
the ruffians rob me. They went through my pockets, and after
they had taken everything they could find, they skipped. After
all, I've come to the conclusion that it's better to live without
money than to die with a pocket full of it.</p>

<h2><a name="ALCMAN"></a>ALCMAN</h2>

<h3>(Seventh Century B.C.)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ccording to legend, this illustrious Grecian lyric poet was
born in Lydia, and taken to Sparta as a slave when very
young, but emancipated by his master on the discovery of
his poetic genius. He flourished probably between 670 and 630, during
the peace following the Second Messenian War. It was that
remarkable period in which the Spartans were gathering poets and
musicians from the outer world of liberal accomplishment to educate
their children; for the Dorians thought it beneath the dignity of a
Dorian citizen to practice these things themselves.</p>

<p>His poetic remains indicate a social freedom at this period hardly
in keeping with the Spartan rigor alleged to have been practiced
without break from the ancient time of Lycurgus; perhaps this communal
asceticism was really a later growth, when the camp of militant
slave-holders saw their fibre weakening under the art and luxury
they had introduced. He boasts of his epicurean appetite; with
evident truthfulness, as a considerable number of his extant fragments
are descriptions of dishes. He would have echoed Sydney
Smith's--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Fate cannot harm me--I have dined to-day.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>In a poem descriptive of spring, he laments that the season affords
but a scanty stock of his favorite viands.</p>

<p>The Alexandrian grammarians put Alcman at the head of the
lyric canon; perhaps partly because they thought him the most
ancient, but he was certainly much esteemed in classic times. <i>Aelian</i>
says his songs were sung at the first performance of the gymnopaedia
at Sparta in 665 B.C., and often afterward. Much of his poetry was
erotic; but he wrote also hymns to the gods, and ethical and philosophic
pieces. His 'Parthenia,' which form a distinct division of
his writings, were songs sung at public festivals by, and in honor of,
the performing chorus of virgins. The subjects were either religious
or erotic. His proverbial wisdom, and the forms of verse which he
often chose, are reputed to have been like Pindar's. He said of himself
that he sang like the birds,--that is, was self-taught.</p>

<p>He wrote in the broad Spartan dialect with a mixture of the
Aeolic, and in various metres. One form of hexameter which he
invented was called Alcmanic after him. His poems were comprehended
in six books. The scanty fragments which have survived are
included in Bergk's 'Poetae Lyrici Graeci' (1878). The longest was
found in 1855 by M. Mariette, in a tomb near the second pyramid.
It is a papyrus fragment of three pages, containing a part of his
hymn to the Dioscuri, much mutilated and difficult to decipher.</p>

<p>His descriptive passages are believed to have been his best. The
best known and most admired of his fragments is his beautiful
description of night, which has been often imitated and paraphrased.</p>

<h2><a name="LOUISA_MAY_ALCOTT"></a>LOUISA MAY ALCOTT</h2>

<h3>(1832-1888)</h3>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-l.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ouisa May Alcott, daughter of Amos Bronson and Abigail
(May) Alcott, and the second of the four sisters whom she
was afterward to make famous in 'Little Women,' was
born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, November 29th, 1832, her father's
thirty-third birthday. On his side, she
was descended from good Connecticut
stock; and on her mother's, from the Mays
and Quincys of Massachusetts, and from
Judge Samuel Sewall, who has left in his
diary as graphic a picture of the New
England home-life of two hundred years
ago, as his granddaughter of the fifth
generation did of that of her own time.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/298.png" width="45%" alt=""></p>

<p>At the time of Louisa Alcott's birth
her father had charge of a school in Germantown;
but within two years he moved
to Boston with his family, and put into
practice methods of teaching so far in
advance of his time that they were unsuccessful. From 1840, the
home of the Alcott family was in Concord, Massachusetts, with the
exception of a short time spent in a community on a farm in a
neighboring town, and the years from 1848 to 1857 in Boston. At
seventeen, Louisa's struggle with life began. She wrote a play, contributed
sensational stories to weekly papers, tried teaching, sewing,--even
going out to service,--and would have become an actress
but for an accident. What she wrote of her mother is as true of
herself, &quot;She always did what came to her in the way of duty or
charity, and let pride, taste, and comfort suffer for love's sake.&quot; Her
first book, 'Flower Fables,' a collection of fairy tales which she had
written at sixteen for the children of Ralph Waldo Emerson, some
other little friends, and her younger sisters, was printed in 1855 and
was well received. From this time until 1863 she wrote many
stories, but few that she afterward thought worthy of being reprinted.
Her best work from 1860 to 1863 is in the Atlantic Monthly,
indexed under her name; and the most carefully finished of her few
poems, 'Thoreau's Flute,' appeared in that magazine in September,
1863. After six weeks' experience in the winter of 1862-63 as a
hospital nurse in Washington, she wrote for the Commonwealth, a
Boston weekly paper, a series of letters which soon appeared in book
form as 'Hospital Sketches,' Miss Alcott says of them, &quot;The
'Sketches' never made much money, but showed me 'my style.'&quot;
In 1864 she published a novel, 'Moods'; and in 1866, after a year
abroad as companion to an invalid, she became editor of Merry's
Museum, a magazine for children.</p>

<p>Her 'Little Women,' founded on her own family life, was written
in 1867-68, in answer to a request from the publishing house of
Roberts Brothers for a story for girls, and its success was so great
that she soon finished a second part. The two volumes were translated
into French, German, and Dutch, and became favorite books in
England. While editing Merry's Museum, she had written the first
part of 'The Old-Fashioned Girl' as a serial for the magazine. After
the success of 'Little Women,' she carried the 'Old-Fashioned Girl'
and her friends forward several years, and ended the story with two
happy marriages. In 1870 she went abroad a second time, and from
her return the next year until her death in Boston from overwork on
March 6th, 1888, the day of her father's funeral, she published twenty
volumes, including two novels: one anonymous, 'A Modern Mephistopheles,'
in the 'No Name' series; the other, 'Work,' largely a record
of her own experience. She rewrote 'Moods,' and changed the sad
ending of the first version to a more cheerful one; followed the fortunes
of her 'Little Women' and their children in 'Little Men' and
'Jo's Boys,' and published ten volumes of short stories, many of
them reprinted pieces. She wrote also 'Eight Cousins,' its sequel
'Rose in Bloom,' 'Under the Lilacs,' and 'Jack and Jill,'</p>

<p>The charm of her books lies in their freshness, naturalness, and
sympathy with the feelings and pursuits of boys and girls. She says
of herself, &quot;I was born with a boy's spirit under my bib and tucker,&quot;
and she never lost it. Her style is often careless, never elegant, for
she wrote hurriedly, and never revised or even read over her manuscript;
yet her books are full of humor and pathos, and preach the
gospel of work and simple, wholesome living. She has been a help
and inspiration to many young girls, who have learned from her Jo
in 'Little Women,' or Polly in the 'Old-Fashioned Girl,' or Christie
in 'Work,' that a woman can support herself and her family without
losing caste or self-respect. Her stories of the comradeship of New
England boys and girls in school or play have made her a popular
author in countries where even brothers and sisters see little of each
other. The haste and lack of care in her books are the result of
writing under pressure for money to support the family, to whom
she gave the best years of her life. As a little girl once said of her
in a school essay, &quot;I like all Miss Alcott's books; but what I like best
in them is the author herself.&quot;</p>

<h3><a name="THE_NIGHT_WARD"></a>THE NIGHT WARD</h3>

<center>From 'Hospital Sketches'</center>

<p>Being fond of the night side of nature, I was soon promoted
to the post of night nurse, with every facility for indulging
in my favorite pastime of &quot;owling.&quot; My colleague, a
black-eyed widow, relieved me at dawn, we two taking care of
the ward between us, like regular nurses, turn and turn about.
I usually found my boys in the jolliest state of mind their condition
allowed; for it was a known fact that Nurse Periwinkle
objected to blue devils, and entertained a belief that he who
laughed most was surest of recovery. At the beginning of my
reign, dumps and dismals prevailed; the nurses looked anxious
and tired, the men gloomy or sad; and a general
&quot;Hark-from-the-tombs-a-doleful-sound&quot; style of conversation seemed to be
the fashion: a state of things which caused one coming from a
merry, social New England town, to feel as if she had got into
an exhausted receiver; and the instinct of self-preservation, to
say nothing of a philanthropic desire to serve the race, caused a
speedy change in Ward No. 1.</p>

<p>More flattering than the most gracefully turned compliment,
more grateful than the most admiring glance, was the sight of
those rows of faces, all strange to me a little while ago, now
lighting up with smiles of welcome as I came among them,
enjoying that moment heartily, with a womanly pride in their
regard, a motherly affection for them all. The evenings were
spent in reading aloud, writing letters, waiting on and amusing
the men, going the rounds with Dr. P---- as he made his second
daily survey, dressing my dozen wounds afresh, giving last doses,
and making them cozy for the long hours to come, till the nine
o'clock bell rang, the gas was turned down, the day nurses went
off duty, the night watch came on, and my nocturnal adventures
began.</p>

<p>My ward was now divided into three rooms; and under favor
of the matron, I had managed to sort out the patients in such a
way that I had what I called my &quot;duty room,&quot; my &quot;pleasure
room,&quot; and my &quot;pathetic room,&quot; and worked for each in a
different way. One I visited armed with a dressing-tray full of
rollers, plasters, and pins; another, with books, flowers, games,
and gossip; a third, with teapots, lullabies, consolation, and sometimes
a shroud.</p>

<p>Wherever the sickest or most helpless man chanced to be,
there I held my watch, often visiting the other rooms to see that
the general watchman of the ward did his duty by the fires and
the wounds, the latter needing constant wetting. Not only on
this account did I meander, but also to get fresher air than the
close rooms afforded; for owing to the stupidity of that mysterious
&quot;somebody&quot; who does all the damage in the world, the
windows had been carefully nailed down above, and the lower
sashes could only be raised in the mildest weather, for the men
lay just below. I had suggested a summary smashing of a few
panes here and there, when frequent appeals to headquarters had
proved unavailing and daily orders to lazy attendants had come
to nothing. No one seconded the motion, however, and the nails
were far beyond my reach; for though belonging to the sisterhood
of &quot;ministering angels,&quot; I had no wings, and might as well
have asked for a suspension bridge as a pair of steps in that
charitable chaos.</p>

<p>One of the harmless ghosts who bore me company during the
haunted hours was Dan, the watchman, whom I regarded with a
certain awe; for though so much together, I never fairly saw his
face, and but for his legs should never have recognized him, as
we seldom met by day. These legs were remarkable, as was his
whole figure: for his body was short, rotund, and done up in a
big jacket and muffler; his beard hid the lower part of his face,
his hat-brim the upper, and all I ever discovered was a pair of
sleepy eyes and a very mild voice. But the legs!--very long,
very thin, very crooked and feeble, looking like gray sausages in
their tight coverings, and finished off with a pair of expansive
green cloth shoes, very like Chinese junks with the sails down.
This figure, gliding noiselessly about the dimly lighted rooms,
was strongly suggestive of the spirit of a beer-barrel mounted on
corkscrews, haunting the old hotel in search of its lost mates,
emptied and staved in long ago.</p>

<p>Another goblin who frequently appeared to me was the attendant
of &quot;the pathetic room,&quot; who, being a faithful soul, was often
up to tend two or three men, weak and wandering as babies,
after the fever had gone. The amiable creature beguiled the
watches of the night by brewing jorums of a fearful beverage
which he called coffee, and insisted on sharing with me; coming
in with a great bowl of something like mud soup, scalding hot,
guiltless of cream, rich in an all-pervading flavor of molasses,
scorch, and tin pot.</p>

<p>Even my constitutionals in the chilly halls possessed a certain
charm, for the house was never still. Sentinels tramped round
it all night long, their muskets glittering in the wintry moonlight
as they walked, or stood before the doors straight and
silent as figures of stone, causing one to conjure up romantic
visions of guarded forts, sudden surprises, and daring deeds; for
in these war times the humdrum life of Yankeedom has vanished,
and the most prosaic feel some thrill of that excitement which
stirs the Nation's heart, and makes its capital a camp of hospitals.
Wandering up and down these lower halls I often heard
cries from above, steps hurrying to and fro, saw surgeons passing
up, or men coming down carrying a stretcher, where lay a long
white figure whose face was shrouded, and whose fight was done.
Sometimes I stopped to watch the passers in the street, the
moonlight shining on the spire opposite, or the gleam of some
vessel floating, like a white-winged sea-gull, down the broad Potomac,
whose fullest flow can never wash away the red stain of
the land.</p>

<h3><a name="AMY'S_VALLEY_OF_HUMILIATION"></a>AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION</h3>

<center>From 'Little Women'</center>

<p>&quot;That boy is a perfect Cyclops, isn't he?&quot; said Amy one day,
as Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of
his whip as he passed.</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? and very
handsome ones they are, too,&quot; cried Jo, who resented any slighting
remarks about her friend.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't say anything about his eyes; and I don't see why
you need fire up when I admire his riding.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my goodness! that little goose means a centaur, and she
called him a Cyclops,&quot; exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;You needn't be so rude; it's only a 'lapse of lingy,' as Mr.
Davis says,&quot; retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. &quot;I just
wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,&quot;
she added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Meg, kindly, for Jo had gone off in another
laugh at Amy's second blunder.</p>

<p>&quot;I need it so much: I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be
my turn to have the rag-money for a month.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In debt, Amy: what do you mean?&quot; and Meg looked sober.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes; and I can't pay
them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbids my having
anything charged at the shop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used
to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls;&quot; and Meg tried to
keep her countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless
you want to be thought mean, you must do it too. It's nothing
but limes now, for every one is sucking them in their desks in
school-time, and trading them off for pencils, bead-rings, paper
dolls, or something else, at recess. If one girl likes another, she
gives her a lime; if she's mad with her, she eats one before her
face, and don't offer even a suck. They treat by turns; and
I've had ever so many, but haven't returned them, and I ought,
for they are debts of honor, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How much will pay them off, and restore your credit?&quot;
asked Meg, taking out her purse.</p>

<p>&quot;A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents
over for a treat for you. Don't you like limes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not much; you may have my share. Here's the money:
make it last as long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, thank you! it must be so nice to have pocket-money.
I'll have a grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I
felt delicate about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and
I'm actually suffering for one.&quot;</p>

<p>Next day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist
the temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist
brown-paper parcel before she consigned it to the inmost recesses
of her desk. During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy
March had got twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the
way), and was going to treat, circulated through her &quot;set&quot; and
the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming. Katy
Brown invited her to her next party on the spot; Mary Kingsley
insisted on lending her her watch till recess; and Jenny Snow,
a satirical young lady who had basely twitted Amy upon her
limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet, and offered to furnish
answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten
Miss Snow's cutting remarks about &quot;some persons whose noses
were not too flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up
people who were not too proud to ask for them&quot;; and she
instantly crushed &quot;that Snow girl's&quot; hopes by the withering telegram,
&quot;You needn't be so polite all of a sudden, for you won't
get any.&quot;</p>

<p>A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that
morning, and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise;
which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and
caused Miss March to assume the airs of a studious young
peacock. But, alas, alas! pride goes before a fall, and the
revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success. No
sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments, and bowed
himself out, than Jenny, under pretence of asking an important
question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had
pickled limes in her desk.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and
solemnly vowed to publicly ferule the first person who was found
breaking the law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in
banishing gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire
of the confiscated novels and newspapers, had suppressed a
private post-office, had forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames,
and caricatures, and done all that one man could do to
keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys are trying
enough to human patience, goodness knows! but girls are
infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical
tempers, and no more talent for teaching than &quot;Dr. Blimber.&quot;
Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra,
and ologies of all sorts, so he was called a fine teacher; and
manners, morals, feelings, and examples were not considered of
any particular importance. It was a most unfortunate moment
for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently
taken his coffee too strong that morning; there was an
east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils
had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved; therefore,
to use the expressive if not elegant language of a school-girl,
&quot;he was as nervous as a witch, and as cross as a bear.&quot; The
word &quot;limes&quot; was like fire to powder: his yellow face flushed,
and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny
skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.</p>

<p>&quot;Young ladies, attention, if you please!&quot;</p>

<p>At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue,
black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his
awful countenance.</p>

<p>&quot;Miss March, come to the desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Amy rose to comply with outward composure; but a secret
fear oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.</p>

<p>&quot;Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,&quot; was the
unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of
her seat.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't take all,&quot; whispered her neighbor, a young lady of
great presence of mind.</p>

<p>Amy hastily shook out half a dozen, and laid the rest down
before Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart
would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately,
Mr. Davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable
pickle, and disgust added to his wrath.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not quite,&quot; stammered Amy.</p>

<p>&quot;Bring the rest, immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>With a despairing glance at her set she obeyed.</p>

<p>&quot;You are sure there are no more?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never lie, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I see. Now take these disgusting things, two by two,
and throw them out of the window.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little
gust as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their
longing lips. Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and
fro twelve mortal times; and as each doomed couple, looking, oh,
so plump and juicy! fell from her reluctant hands, a shout from
the street completed the anguish of the girls, for it told them
that their feast was being exulted over by the little Irish children,
who were their sworn foes. This--this was too much; all
flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable Davis,
and one passionate lime-lover burst into tears.</p>

<p>As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous
&quot;hem,&quot; and said, in his most impressive manner:--</p>

<p>&quot;Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week
ago. I am sorry this has happened; but I never allow my rules
to be infringed, and I <i>never</i> break my word. Miss March, hold
out your hand.&quot;</p>

<p>Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him
an imploring look, which pleaded for her better than the words
she could not utter. She was rather a favorite with &quot;old Davis,&quot;
as of course he was called, and it's my private belief that he
<i>would</i> have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible
young lady had not found vent in a hiss. That hiss, faint as it
was, irritated the irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate.</p>

<p>&quot;Your hand, Miss March!&quot; was the only answer her mute
appeal received; and, too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her
teeth, threw back her head defiantly, and bore without flinching
several tingling blows on her little palm. They were neither
many nor heavy, but that made no difference to her. For the
first time in her life she had been struck; and the disgrace, in
her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her down.</p>

<p>&quot;You will now stand on the platform till recess,&quot; said Mr.
Davis, resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.</p>

<p>That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to
her seat and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied
ones of her few enemies; but to face the whole school with that
shame fresh upon her seemed impossible, and for a second she
felt as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break
her heart with crying. A bitter sense of wrong, and the thought
of Jenny Snow, helped her to bear it; and taking the ignominious
place, she fixed her eyes on the stove-funnel above what now
seemed a sea of faces, and stood there so motionless and white,
that the girls found it very hard to study, with that pathetic
little figure before them.</p>

<p>During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive
little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.
To others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her
it was a hard experience; for during the twelve years of her life
she had been governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort
had never touched her before. The smart of her hand, and the
ache of her heart, were forgotten in the sting of the thought,--&quot;I
shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed
in me!&quot;</p>

<p>The fifteen minutes seemed an hour; but they came to an end
at last, and the word &quot;Recess!&quot; had never seemed so welcome to
her before.</p>

<p>&quot;You can go, Miss March,&quot; said Mr. Davis, looking, as he
felt, uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He did not soon forget the reproachful look Amy gave him, as
she went, without a word to any one, straight into the ante-room,
snatched her things, and left the place &quot;forever,&quot; as she passionately
declared to herself. She was in a sad state when she got
home; and when the older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation
meeting was held at once. Mrs. March did not say
much, but looked disturbed, and comforted her afflicted little
daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the insulted
hand with glycerine, and tears; Beth felt that even her beloved
kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, and Jo wrathfully
proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay; while
Hannah shook her fist at the &quot;villain,&quot; and pounded potatoes for
dinner as if she had him under her pestle.</p>

<p>No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates;
but the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was
quite benignant in the afternoon, and also unusually nervous.
Just before school closed Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression
as she stalked up to the desk and delivered a letter from her
mother; then collected Amy's property and departed, carefully
scraping the mud from her boots on the door-mat, as if she
shook the dust of the place off her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you
to study a little every day with Beth,&quot; said Mrs. March that
evening. &quot;I don't approve of corporal punishment, especially for
girls. I dislike Mr. Davis's manner of teaching, and don't think
the girls you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall
ask your father's advice before I send you anywhere else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his
old school. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely
limes,&quot; sighed Amy with the air of a martyr.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and
deserved some punishment for disobedience,&quot; was the severe
reply, which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected
nothing but sympathy.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole
school?&quot; cried Amy.</p>

<p>&quot;I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,&quot;
replied her mother; &quot;but I'm not sure that it won't do you more
good than a milder method. You are getting to be altogether
too conceited and important, my dear, and it is about time you
set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and
virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils
the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or
goodness will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness
of possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great
charm of all power is modesty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it is,&quot; cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner
with Jo. &quot;I knew a girl once who had a really remarkable
talent for music, and she didn't know it; never guessed what
sweet little things she composed when she was alone, and
wouldn't have believed it if any one had told her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I'd known that nice girl; maybe she would have
helped me, I'm so stupid,&quot; said Beth, who stood beside him
listening eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;You do know her, and she helps you better than any one
else could,&quot; answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous
meaning in his merry eyes, that Beth suddenly turned
very red, and hid her face in the sofa-cushion, quite overcome by
such an unexpected discovery.</p>

<p>Jo let Laurie win the game, to pay for that praise of her
Beth, who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after
her compliment. So Laurie did his best and sung delightfully,
being in a particularly lively humor, for to the Marches he
seldom showed the moody side of his character. When he was
gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening, said suddenly,
as if busy over some new idea:--</p>

<p>&quot;Is Laurie an accomplished boy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent;
he will make a fine man, if not spoilt by petting,&quot; replied her
mother.</p>

<p>&quot;And he isn't conceited, is he?&quot; asked Amy.</p>

<p>&quot;Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all
like him so much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see: it's nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant, but
not to show off, or get perked up,&quot; said Amy thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner
and conversation, if modestly used; but it is not necessary to
display them,&quot; said Mrs. March.</p>

<p>&quot;Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets, and
gowns and ribbons, at once, that folks may know you've got
'em,&quot; added Jo; and the lecture ended in a laugh.</p>

<h2><a name="ALCUIN"></a>ALCUIN</h2>

<h3>(735?-804)</h3>

<h3>BY WILLIAM H. CARPENTER</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>lcuin, usually called Alcuin of York, came of a patrician
family of Northumberland. Neither the date nor the place
of his birth is known with definiteness, but he was born
about 735 at or near York. As a child he entered the cathedral
school recently founded by Egbert, Archbishop of York, and ultimately
became its most eminent pupil. He was subsequently assistant
master to Aelbert, its head; and when Aelbert succeeded to
the archbishopric, on the death of Egbert in 766, Alcuin became
<i>scholasticus</i> or master of the school. On the death of Aelbert in 780,
Alcuin was placed in charge of the cathedral library, the most
famous in Western Europe. In his longest poem, 'Versus de
Eboracensi Ecclesia' (Poem on the Saints of the Church at York),
he has left an important record of his connection with York. This
poem, written before he left England, is, like most of his verse, in
dactylic hexameters. To a certain extent it follows Virgil as a
model, and is partly based on the writings of Bede, partly on his
own personal experience. It is not only valuable for its historical
bearings, but for its disclosure of the manner and matter of instruction
in the schools of the time, and the contents of the great library.
As master of the cathedral school, Alcuin acquired name and fame
at home and abroad, and was soon the most celebrated teacher in
Britain. Before 766, in company with Aelbert, he made his first
journey to Germany, and may have visited Rome. Earlier than 780
he was again abroad, and at Pavia came under the notice of
Charlemagne, who was on his way back from Italy. In 781 Eanbald,
the new Archbishop of York, sent Alcuin to Rome to bring back the
Archbishop's pallium. At Parma he again met Charlemagne, who
invited him to take up his abode at the Frankish court. With the
consent of his king and his archbishop he resigned his position at
York, and with a few pupils departed for the court at Aachen, in 782.</p>

<p>Alcuin's arrival in Germany was the beginning of a new intellectual
epoch among the Franks. Learning was at this time in a
deplorable state. The older monastic and cathedral schools had
been broken up, and the monasteries themselves often unworthily
bestowed upon royal favorites. There had been a palace school for
rudimentary instruction, but it was wholly inefficient and unimportant.</p>

<p>During the years immediately following his arrival, Alcuin zealously
labored at his projects of educational reform. First reorganizing
the palace school, he afterward undertook a reform of the monasteries
and their system of instruction, and the establishment of new schools
throughout the kingdom of Charlemagne. At the court school the
great king himself, as well as Liutgard the queen, became his
pupil. Gisela, Abbess of Chelles, the sister of Charlemagne, came
also to him for instruction, as did the Princes Charles, Pepin, and
Louis, and the Princesses Rotrud and Gisela. On himself and the
others, in accordance with the fashion of the time, Alcuin bestowed
fanciful names. He was Flaccus or Albinus, Charlemagne was
David, the queen was Ava, and Pepin was Julius. The subjects of
instruction in this school, the centre of culture of the kingdom, were
first of all, grammar; then arithmetic, astronomy, rhetoric, and
dialectic. The king himself studied poetry, astronomy, arithmetic,
the writings of the Fathers, and theology proper. It was under the
influence of Alcuin that Charlemagne issued in 787 the capitulary
that has been called &quot;the first general charter of education for the
Middle Ages.&quot; It reproves the abbots for their illiteracy, and exhorts
them to the study of letters; and although its effect was less than
its purpose, it served, with subsequent decrees of the king, to stimulate
learning and literature throughout all Germany.</p>

<p>Alcuin's system included, besides the palace school, and the
monastic and cathedral schools, which in some instances gave both
elementary and superior instruction, all the parish or village elementary
schools, whose head was the parish priest.</p>

<p>In 790, seeing his plans well established, Alcuin returned to York
bearing letters of reconciliation to Offa, King of Mercia, between
whom and Charlemagne dissension had arisen. Having accomplished
his errand, he went back to the German court in 792. Here his first
act was to take a vigorous part in the furious controversy respecting
the doctrine of Adoptionism. Alcuin not only wrote against
the heresy, but brought about its condemnation by the Council of
Frankfort, in 794.</p>

<p>Two years later, at his own request, he was made Abbot of the
Benedictine monastery of St. Martin, at Tours. Not contented with
reforming the lax monastic life, he resolved to make Tours a seat of
learning. Under his management, it presently became the most
renowned school in the kingdom. Especially in the copying of manuscripts
did the brethren excel. Alcuin kept up a vast correspondence
with Britain as well as with different parts of the Frankish
kingdom; and of the two hundred and thirty letters preserved, the
greater part belonged to this time. In 799, at Aachen, he held a
public disputation on Adoptionism with Felix, Bishop of Urgel, who
was wholly vanquished. When the king, in 800, was preparing for
that visit to the Papal court which was to end with his coronation as
Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, he invited Alcuin to accompany
him. But the old man, wearied with many burdens, could not make
the journey. By the beginning of 804 he had become much enfeebled.
It was his desire, often expressed, to die on the day of Pentecost.
His wish was fulfilled, for he died at dawn on the 19th of May. He
was buried in the Cloister Church of St. Martin, near the monastery.</p>

<p>Alcuin's literary activity was exerted in various directions. Two-thirds
of all that he wrote was theological in character. These works
are exegetical, like the 'Commentary on the Gospel of St. John';
dogmatic, like the 'Writings against Felix of Urgel and Elipandus
of Toledo,' his best work of this class; or liturgical and moral, like
the 'Lives of the Saints,' The other third is made up of the epistles,
already mentioned; of poems on a great variety of subjects, the
principal one being the 'Poem on the Saints of the Church at York';
and of those didactic works which form his principal claim to attention
at the present day. His educational treatises are the following:
'On Grammar,' 'On Orthography,' 'On Rhetoric and the Virtues,'
'On Dialectics,' 'Disputation between the Royal and Most Noble
Youth Pepin, and Albinus the Scholastic,' and 'On the Calculation
of Easter,' The most important of all these writings is his 'Grammar,'
which consists of two parts: the first a dialogue between a
teacher and his pupils on philosophy and studies in general; the
other a dialogue between a teacher, a young Frank, and a young
Saxon, on grammar. These latter, in Alcuin's language, have &quot;but
lately rushed upon the thorny thickets of grammatical density&quot;
Grammar begins with the consideration of the letters, the vowels
and consonants, the former of which &quot;are, as it were, the souls, and
the consonants the bodies of words.&quot; Grammar itself is defined
to be &quot;the science of written sounds, the guardian of correct speaking
and writing. It is founded on nature, reason, authority, and
custom.&quot; He enumerates no less than twenty-six parts of grammar,
which he then defines. Many of his definitions and particularly his
etymologies, are remarkable. He tells us that feet in poetry are so
called &quot;because the metres walk on them&quot;; <i>littera</i> is derived from
<i>legitera</i>, &quot;since the <i>littera</i> serve to prepare the way for readers&quot;
(<i>legere, iter</i>). In his 'Orthography,' a pendant to the 'Grammar,'
<i>coelebs</i>, a bachelor, is &quot;one who is on his way <i>ad coelum</i>&quot; (to heaven).
Alcuin's 'Grammar' is based principally on Donatus. In this, as in
all his works, he compiles and adapts, but is only rarely original.
'On Rhetoric and the Virtues' is a dialogue between Charlemagne
and Albinus (Alcuin). The 'Disputation between Pepin and Albinus,'
the beginning of which is here given, shows both the manner
and the subject-matter of his instruction. Alcuin, with all the limitations
which his environment imposed upon him, stamped himself
indelibly upon his day and generation, and left behind him, in his
scholars, an enduring influence. Men like Rabanus, the famous
Bishop of Mayence, gloried in having been his pupils, and down to
the wars and devastations of the tenth century his influence upon
education was paramount throughout all Western Europe. There is
an excellent account of Alcuin in Professor West's 'Alcuin' ('Great
Educators' Series), published in 1893.</p>

Of men and beasts and flying fowl they trace;<br>
Or to the laws of numbers bend their mind,<br>
And search till Easter's annual day they find.<br>
<br>
Then, last and best, he opened up to view<br>
The depths of Holy Scripture, Old and New.<br>
Was any youth in studies well approved,<br>
Then him the master cherished, taught, and loved;<br>
And thus the double knowledge he conferred<br>
Of liberal studies and the Holy Word.<br>

<h3><a name="A_LETTER_FROM_ALCUIN_TO_CHARLEMAGNE"></a>A LETTER FROM ALCUIN TO CHARLEMAGNE</h3>
<center>(Written in the year 796)</center>

<p>I, your Flaccus, in accordance with your entreaty and your
gracious kindness, am busied under the shelter of St. Martin's,
in bestowing upon many of my pupils the honey of
the Holy Scriptures. I am eager that others should drink deep
of the old wine of ancient learning; I shall presently begin to
nourish still others with the fruits of grammatical ingenuity; and
some of them I am eager to enlighten with a knowledge of the
order of the stars, that seem painted, as it were, on the dome
of some mighty palace. I have become all things to all men
(1 Cor. i. 22) so that I may train up many to the profession of
God's Holy Church and to the glory of your imperial realm, lest
the grace of Almighty God in me should be fruitless (1 Cor. xv.
10) and your munificent bounty of no avail. But your servant
lacks the rarer books of scholastic learning, which in my own
country I used to have (thanks to the generous and most devoted
care of my teacher and to my own humble endeavors), and I
mention it to your Majesty so that, perchance, it may please you
who are eagerly concerned about the whole body of learning, to
have me dispatch some of our young men to procure for us certain
necessary works, and bring with them to France the flowers
of England; so that a graceful garden may not exist in York
alone, but so that at Tours as well there may be found the blossoming
of Paradise with its abundant fruits; that the south wind,
when it comes, may cause the gardens along the River Loire to
burst into bloom, and their perfumed airs to stream forth, and
finally, that which follows in the Canticle, whence I have drawn
this simile, may be brought to pass... (Canticle v. 1, 2).
Or even this exhortation of the prophet Isaiah, which urges us to
acquire wisdom:--&quot;A11 ye who thirst, come to the waters; and
you who have not money, hasten, buy and eat: come, without
money and without price, and buy wine and milk&quot; (Isaiah iv. 1.)</p>

<p>And this is a thing which your gracious zeal will not overlook:
how upon every page of the Holy Scriptures we are urged
to the acquisition of wisdom; how nothing is more honorable for
insuring a happy life, nothing more pleasing in the observance,
nothing more efficient against sin, nothing more praiseworthy in
any lofty station, than that men live according to the teachings of
the philosophers. Moreover, nothing is more essential to the government
of the people, nothing better for the guidance of life
into the paths of honorable character, than the grace which wisdom
gives, and the glory of training and the power of learning.
Therefore it is that in its praise, Solomon, the wisest of all men,
exclaims, &quot;Better is wisdom than all precious things, and more
to be desired&quot; (Prov. viii. 11 <i>seq</i>). To secure this with every possible
effort and to get possession of it by daily endeavor, do you,
my lord King, exhort the young men who are in your Majesty's
palace, that they strive for this in the flower of their youth, so
that they may be deemed worthy to live through an old age of
honor, and that by its means they may be able to attain to everlasting
happiness. I, myself, according to my disposition, shall
not be slothful in sowing the seeds of wisdom among your servants
in this land, being mindful of the injunction, &quot;Sow thy
seed in the morning, and at eventide let not thy hand cease;
since thou knowest not what will spring up, whether these or
those, and if both together, still better is it&quot; (Eccles. xi. 6). In
the morning of my life and in the fruitful period of my studies I
sowed seed in Britain, and now that my blood has grown cool in
the evening of life, I still cease not; but sow the seed in France,
desiring that both may spring up by the grace of God. And now
that my body has grown weak, I find consolation in the saying of
St. Jerome, who declares in his letter to Nepotianus, &quot;Almost all
the powers of the body are altered in old men, and wisdom alone
will increase while the rest decay.&quot; And a little further he says,
&quot;The old age of those who have adorned their youth with noble
accomplishments and have meditated on the law of the Lord both
day and night becomes more and more deeply accomplished with
its years, more polished from experience, more wise by the lapse
of time; and it reaps the sweetest fruit of ancient learning.&quot; In
this letter in praise of wisdom, one who wishes can read many
things of the scientific pursuits of the ancients, and can understand
how eager were these ancients to abound in the grace of
wisdom. I have noted that your zeal, which is pleasing to God
and praiseworthy, is always advancing toward this wisdom and
takes pleasure in it, and that you are adorning the magnificence
of your worldly rule with still greater intellectual splendor. In
this may our Lord Jesus Christ, who is himself the supreme type
of divine wisdom, guard you and exalt you, and cause you to
attain to the glory of His own blessed and everlasting vision.</p>

<h3>(1836-)</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-h.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>enry Mills Alden, since 1864 the editor of Harper's Magazine,
was born in Mount Tabor, Vermont, November 11th,
1836, the eighth in descent from Captain John Alden, the
Pilgrim. He graduated at Williams College, and studied theology
at Andover Seminary, but was never ordained a minister, having
almost immediately turned his attention to literature. His first work
that attracted attention was an essay on the Eleusinian Mysteries,
published in the Atlantic Monthly. The scholarship and subtle
method revealed in this and similar works led to his engagement to
deliver a course of twelve Lowell Institute lectures at Boston, in
1863 and 1864, and he took for his subject 'The Structure of Paganism.'
Before this he had removed to New York, had engaged in
general editorial work, and formed his lasting connection with the
house of Harper and Brothers.</p>

<p>As an editor Mr. Alden is the most practical of men, but he is in
reality a poet, and in another age he might have been a mystic.
He has the secret of preserving his life to himself, while paying the
keenest attention to his daily duties. In his office he is immersed in
affairs which require the exercise of vigilant common-sense, and
knowledge of life and literature. At his home he is a serene and
optimistic philosopher, contemplating the forces that make for our
civilization, and musing over the deep problems of man's occupation
of this earth. In 1893 appeared anonymously a volume entitled
'God in His World,' which attracted instantly wide attention in this
country and in England for its subtlety of thought, its boldness of
treatment, its winning sweetness of temper, and its exquisite style.
It was by Mr. Alden, and in 1895 it was followed by 'A Study of
Death,' continuing the great theme of the first,--the unity of creation,
the certainty that there is in no sense a war between the
Creator and his creation. In this view the Universe is not divided
into the Natural and the Supernatural: all is Natural. But we can
speak here only of their literary quality. The author is seen to be a
poet in his conceptions, but in form his writing is entirely within
the limits of prose; yet it is a prose most harmonious, most melodious,
and it exhibits the capacity of our English tongue in the hand of
a master. The thought is sometimes so subtle as to elude the careless
reader, but the charm of the melody never fails to entrance.
The study of life and civilization is profound, but the grace of treatment
seems to relieve the problems of half their difficulty.</p>

<p>His wife did not live to read the exquisite dedication given below.</p>
<br>

<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>
<center>From 'A Study of Death,' 1895, by Harper and Brothers</center>

<h3><a name="A_DEDICATION"></a>A DEDICATION</h3>

<center>TO MY BELOVED WIFE</center>

<p>My earliest written expression of intimate thought or cherished
fancy was for your eyes only; it was my first
approach to your maidenly heart, a mystical wooing, which
neglected no resource, near or remote, for the enhancement of
its charm, and so involved all other mystery in its own.</p>

<p>In you, childhood has been inviolate, never losing its power
of leading me by an unspoken invocation to a green field, ever
kept fresh by a living fountain, where the Shepherd tends his
flock. Now, through a body racked with pain, and sadly broken,
still shines this unbroken childhood, teaching me Love's deepest
mystery.</p>

<p>It is fitting, then, that I should dedicate to you this book
touching that mystery. It has been written in the shadow, but
illumined by the brightness of an angel's face seen in the darkness,
so that it has seemed easy and natural for me to find at
the thorn's heart a secret and everlasting sweetness far surpassing
that of the rose itself, which ceases in its own perfection.</p>

<p>Whether that angel we have seen shall, for my need and
comfort, and for your own longing, hold back his greatest gift,
and leave you mine in the earthly ways we know and love, or
shall hasten to make the heavenly surprise, the issue in either
event will be a home-coming; if <i>here</i>, yet already the deeper
secret will have been in part disclosed; and if <i>beyond</i>, that
secret, fully known, will not betray the fondest hope of loving
hearts. Love never denied Death, and Death will not deny
Love.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DOVE_AND_THE_SERPENT"></a>THE DOVE AND THE SERPENT</h3>

<p>The Dove flies, and the Serpent creeps.  Yet is the Dove
fond, while the Serpent is the emblem of wisdom.  Both
were in Eden: the cooing, fluttering, wing&egrave;d spirit, loving
to descend, companion-like, brooding, following; and the creeping
thing which had glided into the sunshine of Paradise from
the cold bosoms of those nurses of an older world--Pain, and
Darkness, and Death--himself forgetting these in the warmth
and green life of the Garden. And our first parents knew
naught of these as yet unutterable mysteries, any more than
they knew that their roses bloomed over a tomb: so that when
all animate creatures came to Adam to be named, the meaning
of this living allegory which passed before him was in great
part hidden, and he saw no sharp line dividing the firmament
below from the firmament above; rather he leaned toward the
ground, as one does in a garden, seeing how quickly it was
fashioned into the climbing trees, into the clean flowers, and
into his own shapely frame. It was upon the ground he lay
when that deep sleep fell upon him from which he woke to find
his mate, lithe as the serpent, yet with the fluttering heart of
the dove.</p>

<p>As the Dove, though winged for flight, ever descended, so the
Serpent, though unable wholly to leave the ground, tried ever to
lift himself therefrom, as if to escape some ancient bond. The
cool nights revived and nourished his memories of an older time,
wherein lay his subtile wisdom, but day by day his aspiring crest
grew brighter. The life of Eden became for him oblivion, the
light of the sun obscuring and confounding his reminiscence, even
as for Adam and Eve this life was Illusion, the visible disguising
the invisible, and pleasure veiling pain.</p>

<p>In Adam the culture of the ground maintained humility. He
was held, moreover, in lowly content by the charm of the
woman, who was to him like the earth grown human; and since
she was the daughter of Sleep, her love seemed to him restful
as the night. Her raven locks were like the mantle of darkness,
and her voice had the laughter of streams that lapsed into
unseen depths.</p>

<p>But Eve had something of the Serpent's unrest, as if she too
had come from the Under-world, which she would fain forget,
seeking liberation, urged by desire as deep as the abyss she had
left behind her, and nourished from roots unfathomably hidden--the
roots of the Tree of Life. She thus came to have conversation
with the Serpent.</p>

<p>In the lengthening days of Eden's one Summer these two
were more and more completely enfolded in the Illusion of Light.
It was under this spell that, dwelling upon the enticement of
fruit good to look at, and pleasant to the taste, the Serpent
denied Death, and thought of Good as separate from Evil. &quot;Ye
shall not surely die, but shall be as the gods, knowing good and
evil.&quot; So far, in his aspiring day-dream, had the Serpent fared
from his old familiar haunts--so far from his old-world wisdom!</p>

<p>A surer omen would have come to Eve had she listened to
the plaintive notes of the bewildered Dove that in his downward
flutterings had begun to divine what the Serpent had come to
forget, and to confess what he had come to deny.</p>

<p>For already was beginning to be felt &quot;the season's difference,&quot;
and the grave mystery, without which Paradise itself could not
have been, was about to be unveiled,--the background of the
picture becoming its foreground. The fond hands plucking the
rose had found the thorn. Evil was known as something by
itself, apart from Good, and Eden was left behind, as one steps
out of infancy.</p>

<p>From that hour have the eyes of the children of men been
turned from the accursed earth, looking into the blue above,
straining their vision for a glimpse of white-robed angels.</p>

<p>Yet it was the Serpent that was lifted up in the wilderness;
and when He who &quot;became sin for us&quot; was being bruised in the
heel by the old enemy, the Dove descended upon Him at His
baptism. He united the wisdom of the Serpent with the harmlessness
of the Dove. Thus in Him were bound together and
reconciled the elements which in human thought had been put
asunder. In Him, Evil is overcome of Good, as, in Him, Death
is swallowed up of Life; and with His eyes we see that the robes
of angels are white, because they have been washed in blood.</p>

<h3><a name="Death_and_Sleep"></a>Death and Sleep</h3>

<p>The Angel of Death is the invisible Angel of Life. While the
organism is alive as a human embodiment, death is present,
having the same human distinction as the life, from which
it is inseparable, being, indeed, the better half of living,--its
winged half, its rest and inspiration, its secret spring of elasticity,
and quickness.  Life came upon the wings of Death, and so
departs.</p>

<p>If we think of life apart from death our thought is partial, as
if we would give flight to the arrow without bending the bow.
No living movement either begins or is completed save through
death. If the shuttle return not there is no web; and the texture
of life is woven through this tropic movement.</p>

<p>It is a commonly accepted scientific truth that the continuance
of life in any living thing depends upon death. But there
are two ways of expressing this truth: one, regarding merely
the outward fact, as when we say that animal or vegetable tissue
is renewed through decay; the other, regarding the action and
reaction proper to life itself, whereby it forever springs freshly
from its source. The latter form of expression is mystical, in
the true meaning of that term. We close our eyes to the outward
appearance, in order that we may directly confront a mystery
which is already past before there is any visible indication
thereof. Though the imagination engaged in this mystical apprehension
borrows its symbols or analogues from observation and
experience, yet these symbols are spiritually regarded by looking
at life on its living side, and abstracted as far as possible from
outward embodiment. We especially affect physiological analogues
because, being derived from our experience, we may the
more readily have the inward regard of them; and by passing
from one physiological analogue to another, and from all these to
those furnished by the processes of nature outside of our bodies,
we come to an apprehension of the action and reaction proper to
life itself as an idea independent of all its physical representations.</p>

<p>Thus we trace the rhythmic beating of the pulse to the systole
and diastole of the heart, and we note a similar alternation in
the contraction and relaxation of all our muscles. Breathing is
alternately inspiration and expiration. Sensation itself is by beats,
and falls into rhythm. There is no uninterrupted strain of either
action or sensibility; a current or a contact is renewed, having
been broken. In psychical operation there is the same alternate
lapse and resurgence. Memory rises from the grave of oblivion.
No holding can be maintained save through alternate release.
Pulsation establishes circulation, and vital motions proceed through
cycles, each one of which, however minute, has its tropic of Cancer
and of Capricorn. Then there are the larger physiological
cycles, like that wherein sleep is the alternation of waking. Passing
from the field of our direct experience to that of observation,
we note similar alternations, as of day and night, summer and
winter, flood and ebb tide; and science discloses them at every
turn, especially in its recent consideration of the subtle forces of
Nature, leading us back of all visible motions to the pulsations
of the ether....</p>

<p>In considering the action and reaction proper to life itself, we
here dismiss from view all measured cycles, whose beginning and
end are appreciably separate; our regard is confined to living
moments, so fleet that their beginning and ending meet as in one
point, which is seen to be at once the point of departure and of
return. Thus we may speak of a man's life as included between
his birth and his death, and with reference to this physiological
term, think of him as living, and then as dead; but we may also
consider him while living as yet every moment dying, and in this
view death is clearly seen to be the inseparable companion of
life,--the way of return, and so of continuance. This pulsation,
forever a vanishing and a resurgence, so incalculably swift as to
escape observation, is proper to life as life, does not begin with
what we call birth nor end with what we call death (considering
birth and death as terms applicable to an individual existence); it
is forever beginning and forever ending. Thus to all manifest
existence we apply the term Nature (<i>natura</i>), which means &quot;forever
being born&quot;; and on its vanishing side it is <i>moritura</i>, or
&quot;forever dying.&quot; Resurrection is thus a natural and perpetual
miracle. The idea of life as transcending any individual embodiment
is as germane to science as it is to faith.</p>

<p>Death, thus seen as essential, is lifted above its temporary
and visible accidents. It is no longer associated with corruption,
but rather with the sweet and wholesome freshness of life, being
the way of its renewal. Sweeter than the honey which Samson
found in the lion's carcass is this everlasting sweetness of Death;
and it is a mystery deeper than the strong man's riddle.</p>

<p>So is Death pure and clean, as is the dew that comes with the
cool night when the sun has set; clean and white as the snowflakes
that betoken the absolution which Winter gives, shriving
the earth of all her Summer wantonness and excess, when only
the trees that yield balsam and aromatic fragrance remain green,
breaking the box of precious ointment for burial.</p>

<p>In this view also is restored the kinship of Death with Sleep.</p>

<p>The state of the infant seems to be one of chronic mysticism,
since during the greater part of its days its eyes are closed to
the outer world. Its larger familiarity is still with the invisible,
and it seems as if the Mothers of Darkness were still withholding
it as their nursling, accomplishing for it some mighty work
in their proper realm, some such fiery baptism of infants as is
frequently instanced in Greek mythology, tempering them for
earthly trials. The infant must needs sleep while this work is
being done for it; it has been sleeping since the work began,
from the foundation of the world, and the old habit still clings
about it and is not easily laid aside....</p>

<p>That which we have been considering as the death that is in
every moment is a reaction proper to life itself, waking or sleeping,
whereby it is renewed, sharing at once Time and Eternity--time
as outward form, and eternity as its essential quality. Sleep
is a special relaxation, relieving a special strain. As daily we
build with effort and design an elaborate superstructure above
the living foundation, so must this edifice nightly be laid in
ruins. Sleep is thus a disembarrassment, the unloading of a
burden wherewith we have weighted ourselves. Here again we
are brought into a kind of repentance, and receive absolution.
Sleep is forgiveness.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PARABLE_OF_THE_PRODIGAL"></a>THE PARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL</h3>

<h3>I</h3>
<br>

<p>Standing at the gate of Birth, it would seem as if it were the
vital destination of all things to fly from their source, as if
it were the dominant desire of life to enter into limitations.
We might mentally represent to ourselves an essence simple and
indivisible that denies itself in diversified manifold existence. To
us, this side the veil, nay, immeshed in innumerable veils that
hide from us the Father's face, this insistence appears to have
the stress of urgency, as if the effort of all being, its unceasing
travail, were like the beating of the infinite ocean upon the
shores of Time; and as if, within the continent of Time, all
existence were forever knocking at new gates, seeking, through
some as yet untried path of progression, greater complexity, a
deeper involvement. All the children seem to be beseeching the
Father to divide unto them His living, none willingly abiding in
that Father's house. But in reality their will is His will--they
fly, and they are driven, like fledglings from the mother-nest.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>II</h3>
<br>

<p>The story of a solar system, or of any synthesis in time,
repeats the parable of the Prodigal Son, in its essential features.
It is a cosmic parable.</p>

<p>The planet is a wanderer (<i>planes</i>), and the individual planetary
destiny can be accomplished only through flight from its
source. After all its prodigality it shall sicken and return.</p>

<p>Attributing to the Earth, thus apparently separated from the
Sun, some macrocosmic sentience, what must have been her wondering
dream, finding herself at once thrust away and securely
held, poised between her flight and her bond, and so swinging
into a regular orbit about the Sun, while at the same time, in
her rotation, turning to him and away from him--into the light,
and into the darkness, forever denying and confessing her lord!
Her emotion must have been one of delight, however mingled
with a feeling of timorous awe, since her desire could not have
been other than one with her destination. Despite the distance
and the growing coolness she could feel the kinship still; her
pulse, though modulated, was still in rhythm with that of the
solar heart, and in her bosom were hidden consubstantial fires.
But it was the sense of otherness, of her own distinct individuation,
that was mainly being nourished, this sense, moreover,
being proper to her destiny; therefore, the signs of her likeness
to the Sun were more and more being buried from her view;
her fires were veiled by a hardening crust, and her opaqueness
stood out against his light. She had no regret for all she was
surrendering, thinking only of her gain, of being clothed upon
with a garment showing ever some new fold of surprising beauty
and wonder. If she had remained in the Father's house--like
the elder brother in the Parable--then would all that He
had have been hers, in nebulous simplicity. But now, holding
her revels apart, she seems to sing her own song, and to dream
her own beautiful dream, wandering, with a motion wholly her
own, among the gardens of cosmic order and loveliness. She
glories in her many veils, which, though they hide from her both
her source and her very self, are the media through which the
invisible light is broken into multiform illusions that enrich her
dream. She beholds the Sun as a far-off, insphered being existing
for her, her ministrant bridegroom; and when her face is turned
away from him into the night, she beholds innumerable suns, a
myriad of archangels, all witnesses of some infinitely remote and
central flame--the Spirit of all life. Yet, in the midst of these
visible images, she is absorbed in her individual dream, wherein
she appears to herself to be the mother of all living. It is proper
to her destiny that she should be thus enwrapped in her own
distinct action and passion, and refer to herself the appearances
of a universe. While all that is not she is what she really is,--necessary,
that is, to her full definition,--she, on the other hand,
from herself interprets all else. This is the inevitable terrestrial
idealism, peculiar to every individuation in time--the individual
thus balancing the universe.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>III</h3>
<br>
<p>In reality, the Earth has never left the Sun; apart from him
she has no life, any more than has the branch severed from the
vine. More truly it may be said that the Sun has never left the
Earth.</p>

<p>No prodigal can really leave the Father's house, any more than
he can leave himself; coming to himself, he feels the Father's
arms about him--they have always been there--he is newly
appareled, and wears the signet ring of native prestige; he hears
the sound of familiar music and dancing, and it may be that the
young and beautiful forms mingling with him in this festival are
the riotous youths and maidens of his far-country revels, also
come to themselves and home, of whom also the Father saith:
These were dead and are alive again, they were lost and are
found. The starvation and sense of exile had been parts of a
troubled dream--a dream which had also had its ecstasy, but
had come into a consuming fever, with delirious imaginings of
fresh fountains, of shapes drawn from the memory of childhood,
and of the cool touch of kindred hands upon the brow. So near
is exile to home, misery to divine commiseration--so near are
pain and death, desolation and divestiture, to &quot;a new creature,&quot;
and to the kinship involved in all creation and re-creation.</p>

<p>Distance in the cosmic order is a standing-apart, which is only
another expression of the expansion and abundance of creative
life; but at every remove its reflex is nearness, a bond of attraction,
insphering and curving, making orb and orbit. While
in space this attraction is diminished--being inversely as the
square of the distance--and so there is maintained and emphasized
the appearance of suspension and isolation, yet in time it
gains preponderance, contracting sphere and orbit, aging planets
and suns, and accumulating destruction, which at the point of
annihilation becomes a new creation. This Grand Cycle, which is
but a pulsation or breath of the Eternal life, illustrates a truth
which is repeated in its least and most minutely divided moment--that
birth lies next to death, as water crystallizes at the
freezing-point, and the plant blossoms at points most remote from
the source of nutrition.</p>

<h3>(1836-)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p> poet in verse often becomes a poet in prose also, in composing
novels; although the novelist may not, and in general
does not, possess the faculty of writing poems. The
poet-novelist is apt to put into his prose a good deal of the same
charm and the same picturesque choice of phrase and image that
characterize his verse; while it does not follow that the novelist who
at times writes verse--like George Eliot, for example--succeeds in
giving a distinctly poetic quality to prose, or even wishes to do
so. Among authors who have displayed
peculiar power and won fame in the dual
capacity of poet and of prose romancer or
novelist, Sir Walter Scott and Victor Hugo
no doubt stand pre-eminent; and in American
literature, Edgar Allan Poe and Oliver
Wendell Holmes very strikingly combine
these two functions. Another American
author who has gained a distinguished
position both as a poet and as a writer of
prose fiction and essays is Thomas Bailey
Aldrich.
</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/328.png" width="45%" alt=""></p>

<p>It is upon his work in the form of
verse, perhaps, that Aldrich's chief renown
is based; but some of his short stories in especial have contributed
much to his popularity, no less than to his repute as a delicate and
polished artificer in words. A New Englander, he has infused into
some of his poems the true atmosphere of New England, and has
given the same light and color of home to his prose, while imparting
to his productions in both kinds a delightful tinge of the foreign
and remote. In addition to his capacities as a poet and a romancer,
he is a wit and humorist of sparkling quality. In reading his books
one seems also to inhale the perfumes of Arabia and the farther
East, blended with the salt sea-breeze and the pine-scented air of
his native State, New Hampshire.
</p>

<p>He was born in the old seaside town of Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
November 11th, 1836; but moved to New York City in 1854, at
the age of seventeen. There he remained until 1866; beginning his
work quite early; forming his literary character by reading and
observation, by the writing of poems, and by practice and experience
of writing prose sketches and articles for journals and periodicals.
During this period he entered into associations with the poets Stedman,
Stoddard, and Bayard Taylor, and was more or less in touch
with the group that included Walt Whitman, Fitz-James O'Brien,
and William Winter. Removing to Boston in January, 1866, he became
the editor of Every Saturday, and remained in that post until
1874, when he resigned. In 1875 he made a long tour in Europe,
plucking the first fruits of foreign travel, which were succeeded by
many rich and dainty gatherings from the same source in later
years. In the intervals of these wanderings he lived in Boston and
Cambridge; occupying for a time James Russell Lowell's historic
house of Elmwood, in the semi-rural university city; and then established
a pretty country house at Ponkapog, a few miles west of
Boston. This last suggested the title for a charming book of travel
papers, 'From Ponkapog to Pesth.' In 1881 he was appointed editor of
the Atlantic Monthly, and continued to direct that famous magazine
for nine years, frequently making short trips to Europe, extending
his tours as far as the heart of Russia, and gathering fresh materials,
for essay or song. Much of his time since giving up the Atlantic
editorship has been passed in voyaging, and in 1894-5 he made a
journey around the world.
</p>

<p>From the beginning he struck with quiet certainty the vein that
was his by nature in poetry; and this has broadened almost continually,
yielding richer results, which have been worked out with an
increasing refinement of skill. His predilection is for the picturesque;
for romance combined with simplicity, purity, and tenderness of
feeling, touched by fancy and by occasional lights of humor so
reserved and dainty that they never disturb the pictorial harmony.
The capacity for unaffected utterance of feeling on matters common
to humanity reached a climax in the poem of 'Baby Bell,' which
by its sympathetic and delicate description of a child's advent and
death gave the author a claim to the affection^ of a wide circle; and
this remained for a long time probably the best known among his
poems. 'Friar Jerome's Beautiful Book' is another of the earlier
favorites. 'Spring in New England' has since come to hold high
rank both for its vivid and graceful description of the season, for its
tender fervor of patriotism, and for its sentiment of reconciliation
between North and South. The lines on 'Piscataqua River' remain
one of the best illustrations of boyhood memories, and have something
of Whittier's homely truth. In his longer narrative pieces,
'Judith' and 'Wyndham Towers,' cast in the mold of blank-verse
idyls, Mr. Aldrich does not seem so much himself as in many of his
briefer flights. An instinctive dramatic tendency finds outlet in
'Pauline Paulovna' and 'Mercedes'--the latter of which, a two-act
piece in prose, has found representation in the theatre; yet in these,
also, he is less eminently successful than in his lyrics and society
verse.
</p>

<p>No American poet has wrought his stanzas with greater faithfulness
to an exacting standard of craftsmanship than Mr. Aldrich, or
has known better when to leave a line loosely cast, and when to reinforce
it with correction or with a syllable that might seem, to an ear
less true, redundant. This gives to his most carefully chiseled productions
an air of spontaneous ease, and has made him eminent as a
sonneteer. His sonnet on 'Sleep' is one of the finest in the language.
The conciseness and concentrated aptness of his expression
also--together with a faculty of bringing into conjunction subtly
contrasted thoughts, images, or feelings--has issued happily in short,
concentrated pieces like 'An Untimely Thought,' 'Destiny,' and
'Identity,' and in a number of pointed and effective quatrains. Without
overmastering purpose outside of art itself, his is the poetry of
luxury rather than of deep passion or conviction; yet, with the freshness
of bud and tint in springtime, it still always relates itself effectively
to human experience. The author's specially American quality,
also, though not dominant, comes out clearly in 'Unguarded Gates,'
and with a differing tone in the plaintive Indian legend of 'Miantowona.'
</p>

<p>If we perceive in his verse a kinship with the dainty ideals of
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier and Alfred de Musset, this does not obscure his
originality or his individual charm; and the same thing may be said
with regard to his prose. The first of his short fictions that made a
decided mark was 'Marjorie Daw.' The fame which it gained, in
its separate field, was as swift and widespread as that of Hawthorne's
'The Gentle Boy' or Bret Harte's 'Luck of Roaring Camp.' It is a
bright and half-pathetic little parody on human life and affection; or
perhaps we should call it a parable symbolizing the power which
imagination wields over real life, even in supposedly unimaginative
people. The covert smile which it involves, at the importance of
human emotions, may be traced to a certain extent in some of Mr.
Aldrich's longer and more serious works of fiction: his three novels,
'Prudence Palfrey,' 'The Queen of Sheba,' and 'The Stillwater
Tragedy.' 'The Story of a Bad Boy,' frankly but quietly humorous
in its record of the pranks and vicissitudes of a healthy average lad
(with the scene of the story localized at old Portsmouth, under the
name of Rivermouth), a less ambitious work, still holds a secure
place in the affections of many mature as well as younger readers.
Besides these books, Mr. Aldrich has published a collection of short
descriptive, reminiscent, and half-historic papers on Portsmouth,--'An
Old Town by the Sea'; with a second volume of short stories
entitled 'Two Bites at a Cherry.' The character-drawing in his
fiction is clear-cut and effective, often sympathetic, and nearly always
suffused with an agreeable coloring of humor. There are notes of
pathos, too, in some of his tales; and it is the blending of these
qualities, through the medium of a lucid and delightful style, that
defines his pleasing quality in prose.

<i>In Memory of James Russell Lowell</i><br>
<br>
Here, in the twilight, at the well-known gate<br>
I linger, with no heart to enter more.<br>
Among the elm-tops the autumnal air<br>
Murmurs, and spectral in the fading light<br>
A solitary heron wings its way<br>
Southward--save this no sound or touch of life.<br>
Dark is the window where the scholar's lamp<br>
Was used to catch a pallor from the dawn.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I must needs a little linger here.<br>
Each shrub and tree is eloquent of him,<br>
For tongueless things and silence have their speech.<br>
This is the path familiar to his foot<br>
From infancy to manhood and old age;<br>
For in a chamber of that ancient house<br>
His eyes first opened on the mystery<br>
Of life, and all the splendor of the world.<br>
Here, as a child, in loving, curious way,<br>
He watched the bluebird's coming; learned the date<br>
Of hyacinth and goldenrod, and made<br>
Friends of those little redmen of the elms,<br>
And slyly added to their winter store<br>
Of hazel-nuts: no harmless thing that breathed,<br>
Footed or winged, but knew him for a friend.<br>
The gilded butterfly was not afraid<br>
To trust its gold to that so gentle hand,<br>
The bluebird fled not from the pendent spray.<br>
Ah, happy childhood, ringed with fortunate stars!<br>
What dreams were his in this enchanted sphere,<br>
What intuitions of high destiny!<br>
The honey-bees of Hybla touched his lips<br>
In that old New-World garden, unawares.<br>
<br>
So in her arms did Mother Nature fold<br>
Her poet, whispering what of wild and sweet<br>
Into his ear--the state-affairs of birds,<br>
The lore of dawn and sunset, what the wind<br>
Said in the tree-tops--fine, unfathomed things<br>
Henceforth to turn to music in his brain:<br>
A various music, now like notes of flutes,<br>
And now like blasts of trumpets blown in wars.<br>
Later he paced this leafy academe<br>
A student, drinking from Greek chalices<br>
The ripened vintage of the antique world.<br>
And here to him came love, and love's dear loss;<br>
Here honors came, the deep applause of men<br>
Touched to the heart by some swift-wing&egrave;d word<br>
That from his own full heart took eager flight--<br>
Some strain of piercing sweetness or rebuke,<br>
For underneath his gentle nature flamed<br>
A noble scorn for all ignoble deed,<br>
Himself a bondman till all men were free.<br>
<br>
Thus passed his manhood; then to other lands<br>
He strayed, a stainless figure among courts<br>
Beside the Manzanares and the Thames.<br>
Whence, after too long exile, he returned<br>
With fresher laurel, but sedater step<br>
And eye more serious, fain to breathe the air<br>
Where through the Cambridge marshes the blue Charles<br>
Uncoils its length and stretches to the sea:<br>
Stream dear to him, at every curve a shrine<br>
For pilgrim Memory. Again he watched<br>
His loved syringa whitening by the door,<br>
And knew the catbird's welcome; in his walks<br>
Smiled on his tawny kinsmen of the elms<br>
Stealing his nuts; and in the ruined year<br>
Sat at his widowed hearthside with bent brows<br>
Leonine, frosty with the breath of time,<br>
And listened to the crooning of the wind<br>
In the wide Elmwood chimneys, as of old.<br>
And then--and then....<br>
<br>
The after-glow has faded from the elms,<br>
And in the denser darkness of the boughs<br>
From time to time the firefly's tiny lamp<br>
Sparkles. How often in still summer dusks<br>
He paused to note that transient phantom spark<br>
Flash on the air--a light that outlasts him!<br>
<br>
The night grows chill, as if it felt a breath<br>
Blown from that frozen city where he lies.<br>
All things turn strange. The leaf that rustles here<br>
Has more than autumn's mournfulness. The place<br>
Is heavy with his absence. Like fixed eyes<br>
Whence the dear light of sense and thought has fled,<br>
The vacant windows stare across the lawn.<br>
The wise sweet spirit that informed it all<br>
Is otherwhere. The house itself is dead.<br>
<br>
O autumn wind among the sombre pines,<br>
Breathe you his dirge, but be it sweet and low.<br>
With deep refrains and murmurs of the sea,<br>
Like to his verse--the art is yours alone.<br>
His once--you taught him.  Now no voice but yours!<br>
Tender and low, O wind among the pines.<br>
I would, were mine a lyre of richer strings,<br>
In soft Sicilian accents wrap his name.<br>

<a name="SEA_LONGINGS"></a>SEA LONGINGS<br>
<br>
The first world-sound that fell upon my ear<br>
Was that of the great winds along the coast<br>
Crushing the deep-sea beryl on the rocks--<br>
The distant breakers' sullen cannonade.<br>
Against the spires and gables of the town<br>
The white fog drifted, catching here and there<br>
At overleaning cornice or peaked roof,<br>
And hung--weird gonfalons. The garden walks<br>
Were choked with leaves, and on their ragged biers<br>
Lay dead the sweets of summer--damask rose,<br>
Clove-pink, old-fashioned, loved New England flowers<br>
Only keen salt-sea odors filled the air.<br>
Sea-sounds, sea-odors--these were all my world.<br>
Hence is it that life languishes with me<br>
Inland; the valleys stifle me with gloom<br>
And pent-up prospect; in their narrow bound<br>
Imagination flutters futile wings.<br>
Vainly I seek the sloping pearl-white sand<br>
And the mirage's phantom citadels<br>
Miraculous, a moment seen, then gone.<br>
Among the mountains I am ill at ease,<br>
Missing the stretched horizon's level line<br>
And the illimitable restless blue.<br>
The crag-torn sky is not the sky I love,<br>
But one unbroken sapphire spanning all;<br>
And nobler than the branches of a pine<br>
Aslant upon a precipice's edge<br>
Are the strained spars of some great battle-ship<br>
Plowing across the sunset. No bird's lilt<br>
So takes me as the whistling of the gale<br>
Among the shrouds. My cradle-song was this,<br>
Strange inarticulate sorrows of the sea,<br>
Blithe rhythms upgathered from the Sirens' caves.<br>
Perchance of earthly voices the last voice<br>
That shall an instant my freed spirit stay<br>
On this world's verge, will be some message blown<br>
Over the dim salt lands that fringe the coast<br>
At dusk, or when the tranc&egrave;d midnight droops<br>
With weight of stars, or haply just as dawn,<br>
Illumining the sullen purple wave,<br>
Turns the gray pools and willow-stems to gold.<br>

<a name="A_SHADOW_OF_THE_NIGHT"></a>A SHADOW OF THE NIGHT<br>
<br>
Close on the edge of a midsummer dawn<br>
In troubled dreams I went from land to land,<br>
Each seven-colored like the rainbow's arc,<br>
Regions where never fancy's foot had trod<br>
Till then; yet all the strangeness seemed not strange,<br>
At which I wondered, reasoning in my dream<br>
With twofold sense, well knowing that I slept.<br>
At last I came to this our cloud-hung earth,<br>
And somewhere by the seashore was a grave,<br>
A woman's grave, new-made, and heaped with flowers;<br>
And near it stood an ancient holy man<br>
That fain would comfort me, who sorrowed not<br>
For this unknown dead woman at my feet.<br>
But I, because his sacred office held<br>
My reverence, listened; and 'twas thus he spake:--<br>
&quot;When next thou comest thou shalt find her still<br>
In all the rare perfection that she was.<br>
Thou shalt have gentle greeting of thy love!<br>
Her eyelids will have turned to violets,<br>
Her bosom to white lilies, and her breath<br>
To roses. What is lovely never dies,<br>
But passes into other loveliness,<br>
Star-dust, or sea-foam, flower, or wing&egrave;d air.<br>
If this befalls our poor unworthy flesh,<br>
Think thee what destiny awaits the soul!<br>
What glorious vesture it shall wear at last!&quot;<br>
While yet he spoke, seashore and grave and priest<br>
Vanished, and faintly from a neighboring spire<br>
Fell five slow solemn strokes upon my ear.<br>
Then I awoke with a keen pain at heart,<br>
A sense of swift unutterable loss,<br>
And through the darkness reached my hand to touch<br>
Her cheek, soft-pillowed on one restful palm--<br>
To be quite sure!<br>

<h3><a name="PERE_ANTOINE'S_DATE-PALM"></a>P&Egrave;RE ANTOINE'S DATE-PALM</h3>

<p>Near the Lev&eacute;e, and not far from the old French Cathedral in
the Place d'Armes, at New Orleans, stands a fine date-palm,
thirty feet in height, spreading its broad leaves in
the alien air as hardily as if its sinuous roots were sucking
strength from their native earth.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Lyell, in his 'Second Visit to the United States,'
mentions this exotic:--&quot;The tree is seventy or eighty years old;
for P&egrave;re Antoine, a Roman Catholic priest, who died about
twenty years ago, told Mr. Bringier that he planted it himself,
when he was young. In his will he provided that they who succeeded
to this lot of ground should forfeit it if they cut down
the palm.&quot;</p>

<p>Wishing to learn something of P&egrave;re Antoine's history, Sir
Charles Lyell made inquiries among the ancient Creole inhabitants
of the faubourg. That the old priest, in his last days, became
very much emaciated, that he walked about the streets like a
mummy, that he gradually dried up, and finally blew away, was
the meagre and unsatisfactory result of the tourist's investigations.
This is all that is generally told of P&egrave;re Antoine.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1861, while New Orleans was yet occupied
by the Confederate forces, I met at Alexandria, in Virginia, a
lady from Louisiana--Miss Blondeau by name--who gave me
the substance of the following legend touching P&egrave;re Antoine and
his wonderful date-palm. If it should appear tame to the reader,
it will be because I am not habited in a black ribbed-silk dress,
with a strip of point-lace around my throat, like Miss Blondeau;
it will be because I lack her eyes and lips and Southern music
to tell it with.</p>

<p>When P&egrave;re Antoine was a very young man, he had a friend
whom he loved as he loved his life. &Eacute;mile Jardin returned his
passion, and the two, on account of their friendship, became the
marvel of the city where they dwelt. One was never seen without
the other; for they studied, walked, ate, and slept together.</p>

<p>Thus began Miss Blondeau, with the air of Fiammetta telling
her prettiest story to the Florentines in the garden of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Antoine and &Eacute;mile were preparing to enter the Church; indeed,
they had taken the preliminary steps, when a circumstance
occurred which changed the color of their lives. A foreign
lady, from some nameless island in the Pacific, had a few
months before moved into their neighborhood. The lady died
suddenly, leaving a girl of sixteen or seventeen, entirely friendless
and unprovided for. The young men had been kind to the
woman during her illness, and at her death--melting with pity
at the forlorn situation of Anglice, the daughter--swore between
themselves to love and watch over her as if she were their sister.</p>

<p>Now Anglice had a wild, strange beauty that made other
women seem tame beside her; and in the course of time the
young men found themselves regarding their ward not so much
like brothers as at first. In brief, they found themselves in
love with her.</p>

<p>They struggled with their hopeless passion month after month,
neither betraying his secret to the other; for the austere orders
which they were about to assume precluded the idea of love and
marriage. Until then they had dwelt in the calm air of religious
meditations, unmoved except by that pious fervor which in other
ages taught men to brave the tortures of the rack and to smile
amid the flames. But a blonde girl, with great eyes and a voice
like the soft notes of a vesper hymn, had come in between them
and their ascetic dreams of heaven. The ties that had bound
the young men together snapped silently one by one. At last
each read in the pale face of the other the story of his own
despair.</p>

<p>And she? If Anglice shared their trouble, her face told no
story. It was like the face of a saint on a cathedral window.
Once, however, as she came suddenly upon the two men and
overheard words that seemed to burn like fire on the lip of the
speaker, her eyes grew luminous for an instant. Then she passed
on, her face as immobile as before in its setting of wavy gold
hair.</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Entre or et roux Dieu fit ses longs cheveux.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>One night &Eacute;mile and Anglice were missing. They had flown--but
whither, nobody knew, and nobody save Antoine cared.
It was a heavy blow to Antoine--for he had himself half resolved
to confess his love to Anglice and urge her to fly with him.</p>

<p>A strip of paper slipped from a volume on Antoine's <i>priedieu</i>,
and fluttered to his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Do not be angry</i>,&quot; said the bit of paper, piteously; <i>&quot;forgive
us, for we love</i>.&quot; (&quot;Pardonnez-nous, car nous aimons.&quot;)</p>

<p>Three years went by wearily enough. Antoine had entered
the Church, and was already looked upon as a rising man; but
his face was pale and his heart leaden, for there was no sweetness
in life for him.</p>

<p>Four years had elapsed, when a letter, covered with outlandish
postmarks, was brought to the young priest--a letter
from Anglice. She was dying;--would he forgive her? &Eacute;mile,
the year previous, had fallen a victim to the fever that raged on
the island; and their child, Anglice, was likely to follow him.
In pitiful terms she begged Antoine to take charge of the child
until she was old enough to enter the convent of the Sacr&eacute;-Coeur.
The epistle was finished hastily by another hand, informing
Antoine of Madame Jardin's death; it also told him that
Anglice had been placed on board a vessel shortly to leave the
island for some Western port.</p>

<p>The letter, delayed by storm and shipwreck, was hardly read
and wept over when little Anglice arrived.</p>

<p>On beholding her, Antoine uttered a cry of joy and surprise--she
was so like the woman he had worshiped.</p>

<p>The passion that had been crowded down in his heart broke
out and lavished its richness on this child, who was to him
not only the Anglice of years ago, but his friend &Eacute;mile Jardin
also.</p>

<p>Anglice possessed the wild, strange beauty of her mother--the
bending, willowy form, the rich tint of skin, the large tropical
eyes, that had almost made Antoine's sacred robes a mockery
to him.</p>

<p>For a month or two Anglice was wildly unhappy in her new
home. She talked continually of the bright country where she
was born, the fruits and flowers and blue skies, the tall, fan-like
trees, and the streams that went murmuring through them to
the sea. Antoine could not pacify her.</p>

<p>By and by she ceased to weep, and went about the cottage in
a weary, disconsolate way that cut Antoine to the heart. A
long-tailed paroquet, which she had brought with her in the ship,
walked solemnly behind her from room to room, mutely pining,
it seemed, for those heavy orient airs that used to ruffle its brilliant
plumage.</p>

<p>Before the year ended, he noticed that the ruddy tinge had
faded from her cheek, that her eyes had grown languid, and her
slight figure more willowy than ever.</p>

<p>A physician was consulted. He could discover nothing wrong
with the child, except this fading and drooping. He failed to
account for that. It was some vague disease of the mind, he
said, beyond his skill.</p>

<p>So Anglice faded day after day. She seldom left the room
now. At last Antoine could not shut out the fact that the child
was passing away. He had learned to love her so!</p>

<p>&quot;Dear heart,&quot; he said once, &quot;What is't ails thee?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, mon p&egrave;re,&quot; for so she called him.</p>

<p>The winter passed, the balmy spring had come with its magnolia
blooms and orange blossoms, and Anglice seemed to revive.
In her small bamboo chair, on the porch, she swayed to and fro
in the fragrant breeze, with a peculiar undulating motion, like a
graceful tree.</p>

<p>At times something seemed to weigh upon her mind. Antoine
observed it, and waited. Finally she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Near our house,&quot; said little Anglice--&quot;near our house, on
the island, the palm-trees are waving under the blue sky. Oh,
how beautiful! I seem to lie beneath them all day long. I am
very, very happy. I yearned for them so much that I grew ill--don't
you think it was so, mon p&egrave;re?</p>

<p>&quot;H&eacute;las, yes!&quot; exclaimed Antoine, suddenly. &quot;Let us hasten
to those pleasant islands where the palms are waving.&quot;</p>

<p>Anglice smiled. &quot;I am going there, mon p&egrave;re.&quot;</p>

<p>A week from that evening the wax candles burned at her
feet and forehead, lighting her on the journey.</p>

<p>All was over. Now was Antoine's heart empty. Death, like
another &Eacute;mile, had stolen his new Anglice. He had nothing to
do but to lay the blighted flower away.</p>

<p>P&egrave;re Antoine made a shallow grave in his garden, and heaped
the fresh brown mold over his idol.</p>

<p>In the tranquil spring evenings, the priest was seen sitting
by the mound, his finger closed in the unread breviary.</p>

<p>The summer broke on that sunny land; and in the cool morning
twilight, and after nightfall, Antoine lingered by the grave.
He could never be with it enough.</p>

<p>One morning he observed a delicate stem, with two curiously
shaped emerald leaves, springing up from the centre of the
mound. At first he merely noticed it casually; but presently
the plant grew so tall, and was so strangely unlike anything he
had ever seen before, that he examined it with care.</p>

<p>How straight and graceful and exquisite it was! When it
swung to and fro with the summer wind, in the twilight, it
seemed to Antoine as if little Anglice were standing there in the
garden.</p>

<p>The days stole by, and Antoine tended the fragile shoot,
wondering what manner of blossom it would unfold, white, or
scarlet, or golden. One Sunday, a stranger, with a bronzed,
weather-beaten face like a sailor's, leaned over the garden rail, and
said to him, &quot;What a fine young date-palm you have there, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; cried P&egrave;re Antoine starting, &quot;and is it a palm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; returned the man. &quot;I didn't reckon the tree
would flourish in this latitude.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, mon Dieu!&quot; was all the priest could say aloud; but he
murmured to himself, &quot;Bon Dieu, vous m'avez donn&eacute; cela!&quot;</p>

<p>If P&egrave;re Antoine loved the tree before, he worshiped it now.
He watered it, and nurtured it, and could have clasped it in his
arms. Here were &Eacute;mile and Anglice and the child, all in one!</p>

<p>The years glided away, and the date-palm and the priest
grew together--only one became vigorous and the other feeble.
P&egrave;re Antoine had long passed the meridian of life. The tree
was in its youth. It no longer stood in an isolated garden; for
pretentious brick and stucco houses had clustered about Antoine's
cottage. They looked down scowling on the humble thatched
roof. The city was edging up, trying to crowd him off his land.
But he clung to it like lichen and refused to sell.</p>

<p>Speculators piled gold on his doorsteps, and he laughed at
them. Sometimes he was hungry, and cold, and thinly clad; but
he laughed none the less.</p>

<p>&quot;Get thee behind me, Satan!&quot; said the old priest's smile.</p>

<p>P&egrave;re Antoine was very old now, scarcely able to walk; but
he could sit under the pliant, caressing leaves of his palm, loving
it like an Arab; and there he sat till the grimmest of speculators
came to him. But even in death P&egrave;re Antoine was
faithful to his trust: the owner of that land loses it if he harm
the date-tree.</p>

<p>And there it stands in the narrow, dingy street, a beautiful,
dreamy stranger, an exquisite foreign lady whose grace is a joy
to the eye, the incense of whose breath makes the air enamored.
May the hand wither that touches her ungently!</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Because it grew from the heart of little Anglice</i>,&quot; said Miss
Blondeau tenderly.</p>

<center>THE OLD TAVERN AT BAYLEY'S FOUR-CORNERS</center>

<p>You will not find Greenton, or Bayley's Four-Corners as it is
more usually designated, on any map of New England that
I know of. It is not a town; it is not even a village: it is
merely an absurd hotel. The almost indescribable place called
Greenton is at the intersection of four roads, in the heart of New
Hampshire, twenty miles from the nearest settlement of note, and
ten miles from any railway station. A good location for a hotel,
you will say. Precisely; but there has always been a hotel
there, and for the last dozen years it has been pretty well
patronized--by one boarder. Not to trifle with an intelligent
public, I will state at once that, in the early part of this century,
Greenton was a point at which the mail-coach on the Great
Northern Route stopped to change horses and allow the passengers
to dine. People in the county, wishing to take the early
mail Portsmouth-ward, put up over night at the old tavern,
famous for its irreproachable larder and soft feather-beds. The
tavern at that time was kept by Jonathan Bayley, who rivaled
his wallet in growing corpulent, and in due time passed away.
At his death the establishment, which included a farm, fell into
the hands of a son-in-law. Now, though Bayley left his son-in-law
a hotel--which sounds handsome--he left him no guests;
for at about the period of the old man's death the old stage-coach
died also. Apoplexy carried off one, and steam the other.
Thus, by a sudden swerve in the tide of progress, the tavern at
the Corners found itself high and dry, like a wreck on a sand-bank.
Shortly after this event, or maybe contemporaneously,
there was some attempt to build a town at Greenton; but it
apparently failed, if eleven cellars choked up with <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and
overgrown with burdocks are any indication of failure. The
farm, however, was a good farm, as things go in New Hampshire,
and Tobias Sewell, the son-in-law, could afford to snap
his fingers at the traveling public if they came near enough--which
they never did.</p>

<p>The hotel remains to-day pretty much the same as when
Jonathan Bayley handed in his accounts in 1840, except that
Sewell has from time to time sold the furniture of some of the
upper chambers to bridal couples in the neighborhood. The bar
is still open, and the parlor door says PARLOUR in tall black
letters. Now and then a passing drover looks in at that lonely
bar-room, where a high-shouldered bottle of Santa Cruz rum
ogles with a peculiarly knowing air a shriveled lemon on a
shelf; now and then a farmer rides across country to talk crops
and stock and take a friendly glass with Tobias; and now and
then a circus caravan with speckled ponies, or a menagerie with
a soggy elephant, halts under the swinging sign, on which there
is a dim mail-coach with four phantomish horses driven by a
portly gentleman whose head has been washed off by the rain.
Other customers there are none, except that one regular boarder
whom I have mentioned.</p>

<p>If misery makes a man acquainted with strange bed-fellows,
it is equally certain that the profession of surveyor and civil
engineer often takes one into undreamed-of localities. I had
never heard of Greenton until my duties sent me there, and kept
me there two weeks in the dreariest season of the year. I do
not think I would, of my own volition, have selected Greenton
for a fortnight's sojourn at any time; but now the business is
over, I shall never regret the circumstances that made me the
guest of Tobias Sewell, and brought me into intimate relations
with Miss Mehetabel's Son.</p>

<p>It was a black October night in the year of grace 1872, that
discovered me standing in front of the old tavern at the Corners.
Though the ten miles' ride from K---- had been depressing,
especially the last five miles, on account of the cold autumnal
rain that had set in, I felt a pang of regret on hearing the
rickety open wagon turn round in the road and roll off in the
darkness. There were no lights visible anywhere, and only for
the big, shapeless mass of something in front of me, which the
driver had said was the hotel, I should have fancied that I had
been set down by the roadside. I was wet to the skin and in
no amiable humor; and not being able to find bell-pull or
knocker, or even a door, I belabored the side of the house with
my heavy walking-stick. In a minute or two I saw a light
flickering somewhere aloft, then I heard the sound of a window
opening, followed by an exclamation of disgust as a blast of
wind extinguished the candle which had given me an instantaneous
picture <i>en silhouette</i> of a man leaning out of a casement.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, what do you want, down there?&quot; inquired an unprepossessing
voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to come in; I want a supper, and a bed, and numberless
things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This isn't no time of night to go rousing honest folks out
of their sleep. Who are you, anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>The question, superficially considered, was a very simple one,
and I, of all people in the world, ought to have been able to
answer it off-hand; but it staggered me. Strangely enough, there
came drifting across my memory the lettering on the back of a
metaphysical work which I had seen years before on a shelf in
the Astor Library. Owing to an unpremeditatedly funny collocation
of title and author, the lettering read as follows:--&quot;Who
am I? Jones.&quot; Evidently it had puzzled Jones to know who
he was, or he wouldn't have written a book about it, and come
to so lame and impotent a conclusion. It certainly puzzled me
at that instant to define my identity. &quot;Thirty years ago,&quot; I
reflected, &quot;I was nothing; fifty years hence I shall be nothing
again, humanly speaking. In the mean time, who am I, sure
enough?&quot; It had never before occurred to me what an indefinite
article I was. I wish it had not occurred to me then. Standing
there in the rain and darkness, I wrestled vainly with the problem,
and was constrained to fall back upon a Yankee expedient.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't this a hotel?&quot; I asked finally.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it is a sort of hotel,&quot; said the voice, doubtfully. My
hesitation and prevarication had apparently not inspired my interlocutor
with confidence in me.</p>

<p>&quot;Then let me in. I have just driven over from K---- in
this infernal rain. I am wet through and through.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what do you want here, at the Corners? What's your
business? People don't come here, leastways in the middle of
the night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't in the middle of the night,&quot; I returned, incensed.
&quot;I come on business connected with the new road. I'm the
superintendent of the works.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if you don't open the door at once, I'll raise the whole
neighborhood--and then go to the other hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>When I said that, I supposed Greenton was a village with a
population of at least three or four thousand, and was wondering
vaguely at the absence of lights and other signs of human
habitation. Surely, I thought, all the people cannot be abed and
asleep at half past ten o'clock: perhaps I am in the business
section of the town, among the shops.</p>

<p>&quot;You jest wait,&quot; said the voice above.</p>

<p>This request was not devoid of a certain accent of menace,
and I braced myself for a sortie on the part of the besieged, if
he had any such hostile intent. Presently a door opened at the
very place where I least expected a door, at the farther end of
the building, in fact, and a man in his shirt-sleeves, shielding a
candle with his left hand, appeared on the threshold. I passed
quickly into the house, with Mr. Tobias Sewell (for this was
Mr. Sewell) at my heels, and found myself in a long, low-studded
bar-room.</p>

<p>There were two chairs drawn up before the hearth, on which
a huge hemlock back-log was still smoldering, and on the unpainted
deal counter contiguous stood two cloudy glasses with
bits of lemon-peel in the bottom, hinting at recent libations.
Against the discolored wall over the bar hung a yellowed hand-bill,
in a warped frame, announcing that &quot;the Next Annual
N.H. Agricultural Fair&quot; would take place on the 10th of September,
1841. There was no other furniture or decoration in
this dismal apartment, except the cobwebs which festooned the
ceiling, hanging down here and there like stalactites.</p>

<p>Mr. Sewell set the candlestick on the mantel-shelf, and threw
some pine-knots on the fire, which immediately broke into a
blaze, and showed him to be a lank, narrow-chested man, past
sixty, with sparse, steel-gray hair, and small, deep-set eyes, perfectly
round, like a fish's, and of no particular color. His chief
personal characteristics seemed to be too much feet and not
enough teeth. His sharply cut, but rather simple face, as he
turned it towards me, wore a look of interrogation. I replied to
his mute inquiry by taking out my pocket-book and handing him
my business-card, which he held up to the candle and perused
with great deliberation.</p>

<p>&quot;You're a civil engineer, are you?&quot; he said, displaying his
gums, which gave his countenance an expression of almost infantile
innocence. He made no further audible remark, but mumbled
between his thin lips something which an imaginative person
might have construed into, &quot;If you're a civil engineer, I'll be
blessed if I wouldn't like to see an uncivil one!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Sewell's growl, however, was worse than his bite,--owing
to his lack of teeth, probably--for he very good-naturedly set
himself to work preparing supper for me. After a slice of cold
ham, and a warm punch, to which my chilled condition gave a
grateful flavor, I went to bed in a distant chamber in a most
amiable mood, feeling satisfied that Jones was a donkey to
bother himself about his identity.</p>

<p>When I awoke, the sun was several hours high. My bed
faced a window, and by raising myself on one elbow I could
look out on what I expected would be the main street. To my
astonishment I beheld a lonely country road winding up a sterile
hill and disappearing over the ridge. In a cornfield at the right
of the road was a small private graveyard, inclosed by a crumbling
stone wall with a red gate. The only thing suggestive of
life was this little corner lot occupied by death. I got out of
bed and went to the other window. There I had an uninterrupted
view of twelve miles of open landscape, with Mount
Agamenticus in the purple distance. Not a house or a spire in
sight. &quot;Well,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;Greenton doesn't appear to be a
very closely packed metropolis!&quot; That rival hotel with which I
had threatened Mr. Sewell overnight was not a deadly weapon,
looking at it by daylight. &quot;By Jove!&quot; I reflected, &quot;maybe I'm
in the wrong place.&quot; But there, tacked against a panel of the
bedroom door, was a faded time-table dated Greenton, August
1st, 1839.</p>

<p>I smiled all the time I was dressing, and went smiling downstairs,
where I found Mr. Sewell, assisted by one of the fair sex
in the first bloom of her eightieth year, serving breakfast for
me on a small table--in the bar-room!</p>

<p>&quot;I overslept myself this morning,&quot; I remarked apologetically,
&quot;and I see that I am putting you to some trouble. In future,
if you will have me called, I will take my meals at the usual
<i>table d'h&ocirc;te.</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At the what?&quot; said Mr. Sewell.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean with the other boarders.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Sewell paused in the act of lifting a chop from the fire,
and, resting the point of his fork against the woodwork of the
mantel-piece, grinned from ear to ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless you! there isn't any other boarders. There hasn't
been anybody put up here sence--let me see--sence father-in-law
died, and that was in the fall of '40. To be sure, there's
Silas; <i>he's</i> a regular boarder; but I don't count him.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Sewell then explained how the tavern had lost its custom
when the old stage line was broken up by the railroad. The
introduction of steam was, in Mr. Sewell's estimation, a fatal
error. &quot;Jest killed local business. Carried it off, I'm darned if
I know where. The whole country has been sort o' retrograding
ever sence steam was invented.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You spoke of having one boarder,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Silas? Yes; he come here the summer 'Tilda died--she
that was 'Tilda Bayley--and he's here yet, going on thirteen
year. He couldn't live any longer with the old man. Between
you and I, old Clem Jaffrey, Silas's father, was a hard nut.
Yes,&quot; said Mr. Sewell, crooking his elbow in inimitable pantomime,
&quot;altogether too often. Found dead in the road hugging
a three-gallon demijohn. <i>Habeas corpus</i> in the barn,&quot; added Mr.
Sewell, intending, I presume, to intimate that a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination had been deemed necessary. &quot;Silas,&quot; he resumed,
in that respectful tone which one should always adopt when speaking
of capital, &quot;is a man of considerable property; lives on his
interest, and keeps a hoss and shay. He's a great scholar, too,
Silas: takes all the pe-ri-odicals and the Police Gazette regular.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Sewell was turning over a third chop, when the door
opened and a stoutish, middle-aged little gentleman, clad in deep
black, stepped into the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Silas Jaffrey,&quot; said Mr. Sewell, with a comprehensive sweep
of his arm, picking up me and the new-comer on one fork, so to
speak. &quot;Be acquainted!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Jaffrey advanced briskly, and gave me his hand with
unlooked-for cordiality. He was a dapper little man, with a
head as round and nearly as bald as an orange, and not unlike
an orange in complexion, either; he had twinkling gray eyes and
a pronounced Roman nose, the numerous freckles upon which
were deepened by his funereal dress-coat and trousers. He
reminded me of Alfred de Musset's blackbird, which, with its
yellow beak and sombre plumage, looked like an undertaker
eating an omelet.</p>

<p>&quot;Silas will take care of you,&quot; said Mr. Sewell, taking down
his hat from a peg behind the door. &quot;I've got the cattle to look
after. Tell him if you want anything.&quot;</p>

<p>While I ate my breakfast, Mr. Jaffrey hopped up and down
the narrow bar-room and chirped away as blithely as a bird on a
cherry-bough, occasionally ruffling with his fingers a slight fringe
of auburn hair which stood up pertly round his head and seemed
to possess a luminous quality of its own.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't I find it a little slow up here at the Corners? Not at
all, my dear sir. I am in the thick of life up here. So many
interesting things going on all over the world--inventions, discoveries,
spirits, railroad disasters, mysterious homicides. Poets,
murderers, musicians, statesmen, distinguished travelers, prodigies
of all kinds turning up everywhere. Very few events or
persons escape me. I take six daily city papers, thirteen weekly
journals, all the monthly magazines, and two quarterlies. I
could not get along with less. I couldn't if you asked me. I
never feel lonely. How can I, being on intimate terms, as it
were, with thousands and thousands of people? There's that
young woman out West. What an entertaining creature <i>she</i>
is!--now in Missouri, now in Indiana, and now in Minnesota,
always on the go, and all the time shedding needles from various
parts of her body as if she really enjoyed it! Then there's
that versatile patriarch who walks hundreds of miles and saws
thousands of feet of wood, before breakfast, and shows no signs
of giving out. Then there's that remarkable, one may say that
historical colored woman who knew Benjamin Franklin, and
fought at the battle of Bunk--no, it is the old negro man who
fought at Bunker Hill, a mere infant, of course, at that period.
Really, now, it is quite curious to observe how that venerable
female slave--formerly an African princess--is repeatedly dying
in her hundred and eleventh year, and coming to life again
punctually every six months in the small-type paragraphs. Are
you aware, sir, that within the last twelve years no fewer than
two hundred and eighty-seven of General Washington's colored
coachmen have died?&quot;</p>

<p>For the soul of me I could not tell whether this quaint little
gentleman was chaffing me or not. I laid down my knife and
fork, and stared at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Then there are the mathematicians!&quot; he cried vivaciously,
without waiting for a reply. &quot;I take great interest in them.
Hear this!&quot; and Mr. Jaffrey drew a newspaper from a pocket in
the tail of his coat, and read as follows:--&quot;<i>It has been estimated
that if all the candles manufactured by this eminent firm</i> (<i>Stearine
&amp; Co.</i>)<i> were placed end to end, they would reach 2 and 7-8
times around the globe</i>. Of course,&quot; continued Mr. Jaffrey, folding
up the journal reflectively, &quot;abstruse calculations of this
kind are not, perhaps, of vital importance, but they indicate
the intellectual activity of the age. Seriously, now,&quot; he said,
halting in front of the table, &quot;what with books and papers and
drives about the country, I do not find the days too long,
though I seldom see any one, except when I go over to
K---- for my mail. Existence may be very full to a man who
stands a little aside from the tumult and watches it with philosophic
eye. Possibly he may see more of the battle than those
who are in the midst of the action. Once I was struggling with
the crowd, as eager and undaunted as the best; perhaps I should
have been struggling still. Indeed, I know my life would have
been very different now if I had married Mehetabel--if I had
married Mehetabel.&quot;</p>

<p>His vivacity was gone, a sudden cloud had come over his
bright face, his figure seemed to have collapsed, the light
seemed to have faded out of his hair. With a shuffling step,
the very antithesis of his brisk, elastic tread, he turned to the
door and passed into the road.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;if Greenton had forty thousand
inhabitants, it couldn't turn out a more astonishing old party
than that!&quot;</p>
<br>

<h3>II</h3>

<center>THE CASE OF SILAS JAFFREY</center>
<br>

<p>A man with a passion for <i>bric-a-brac</i> is always stumbling over
antique bronzes, intaglios, mosaics, and daggers of the time of
Benvenuto Cellini; the bibliophile finds creamy vellum folios
and rare Alduses and Elzevirs waiting for him at unsuspected
bookstalls; the numismatist has but to stretch forth his palm
to have priceless coins drop into it. My own weakness is odd
people, and I am constantly encountering them. It was plain
that I had unearthed a couple of very queer specimens at
Bayley's Four-Corners. I saw that a fortnight afforded me too
brief an opportunity to develop the richness of both, and I
resolved to devote my spare time to Mr. Jaffrey alone, instinctively
recognizing in him an unfamiliar species. My professional
work in the vicinity of Greenton left my evenings and occasionally
an afternoon unoccupied; these intervals I purposed to
employ in studying and classifying my fellow-boarder. It was
necessary, as a preliminary step, to learn something of his
previous history, and to this end I addressed myself to Mr.
Sewell that same night,</p>

<p>&quot;I do not want to seem inquisitive,&quot; I said to the landlord,
as he was fastening up the bar, which, by the way, was the
<i>salle &agrave; manger</i> and general sitting-room--&quot;I do not want to
seem inquisitive, but your friend Mr. Jaffrey dropped a remark
this morning at breakfast which--which was not altogether
clear to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About Mehetabel?&quot; asked Mr. Sewell, uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I wish he wouldn't!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was friendly enough in the course of conversation to
hint to me that he had not married the young woman, and
seemed to regret it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, he didn't marry Mehetabel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May I inquire <i>why</i> he didn't marry Mehetabel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never asked her. Might have married the girl forty times.
Old Elkins's daughter, over at K----. She'd have had him
quick enough. Seven years, off and on, he kept company with
Mehetabel, and then she died.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he never asked her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He shilly-shallied. Perhaps he didn't think of it. When
she was dead and gone, then Silas was struck all of a heap--and
that's all about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously Mr. Sewell did not intend to tell me anything
more, and obviously there was more to tell. The topic was
plainly disagreeable to him for some reason or other, and that
unknown reason of course piqued my curiosity.</p>

<p>As I was absent from dinner and supper that day, I did not
meet Mr. Jaffrey again until the following morning at breakfast.
He had recovered his bird-like manner, and was full of
a mysterious assassination that had just taken place in New
York, all the thrilling details of which were at his fingers' ends.
It was at once comical and sad to see this harmless old gentleman,
with his na&iuml;ve, benevolent countenance, and his thin
hair flaming up in a semicircle, like the footlights at a theatre,
reveling in the intricacies of the unmentionable deed.</p>

<p>&quot;You come up to my room to-night,&quot; he cried, with horrid
glee, &quot;and I'll give you my theory of the murder. I'll make it
as clear as day to you that it was the detective himself who
fired the three pistol-shots.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not so much the desire to have this point elucidated
as to make a closer study of Mr. Jaffrey that led me to accept
his invitation. Mr. Jaffrey's bedroom was in an L of the
building, and was in no way noticeable except for the numerous
files of newspapers neatly arranged against the blank
spaces of the walls, and a huge pile of old magazines which
stood in one corner, reaching nearly up to the ceiling, and
threatening to topple over each instant, like the Leaning Tower
at Pisa. There were green paper shades at the windows, some
faded chintz valances about the bed, and two or three easy-chairs
covered with chintz. On a black-walnut shelf between
the windows lay a choice collection of meerschaum and brier-wood
pipes.</p>

<p>Filling one of the chocolate-colored bowls for me and another
for himself, Mr. Jaffrey began prattling; but not about
the murder, which appeared to have flown out of his mind. In
fact, I do not remember that the topic was even touched upon,
either then or afterwards.</p>

<p>&quot;Cozy nest this,&quot; said Mr. Jaffrey, glancing complacently over
the apartment. &quot;What is more cheerful, now, in the fall
of the year, than an open wood-fire? Do you hear those little
chirps and twitters coming out of that piece of apple-wood?
Those are the ghosts of the robins and bluebirds that sang
upon the bough when it was in blossom last spring. In summer
whole flocks of them come fluttering about the fruit-trees
under the window: so I have singing birds all the year round.
I take it very easy here, I can tell you, summer and winter.
Not much society. Tobias is not, perhaps, what one would
term a great intellectual force, but he means well. He's a
realist--believes in coming down to what he calls (the hardpan);
but his heart is in the right place, and he's very kind to me.
The wisest thing I ever did in my life was to sell out my grain
business over at K----, thirteen years ago, and settle down at
the Corners. When a man has made a competency, what does
he want more? Besides, at that time an event occurred which
destroyed any ambition I may have had. Mehetabel died.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The lady you were engaged to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not precisely engaged. I think it was quite understood
between us, though nothing had been said on the subject.
Typhoid,&quot; added Mr. Jaffrey, in a low voice.</p>

<p>For several minutes he smoked in silence, a vague, troubled
look playing over his countenance. Presently this passed away,
and he fixed his gray eyes speculatively upon my face.</p>

<p>&quot;If I had married Mehetabel,&quot; said Mr. Jaffrey, slowly, and
then he hesitated. I blew a ring of smoke into the air, and,
resting my pipe on my knee, dropped into an attitude of
attention. &quot;If I had married Mehetabel, you know, we should
have had--ahem!--a family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very likely,&quot; I assented, vastly amused at this unexpected
turn.</p>

<p>&quot;A Boy!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Jaffrey, explosively.</p>

<p>&quot;By all means, certainly, a son.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great trouble about naming the boy. Mehetabel's family
want him named Elkanah Elkins, after her grandfather; I want
him named Andrew Jackson. We compromise by christening
him Elkanah Elkins Andrew Jackson Jaffrey. Rather a long
name for such a short little fellow,&quot; said Mr. Jaffrey, musingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Andy isn't a bad nickname,&quot; I suggested.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. We call him Andy, in the family. Somewhat
fractious at first--colic and things. I suppose it is right, or it
wouldn't be so; but the usefulness of measles, mumps, croup,
whooping-cough, scarlatina, and fits is not clear to the parental
eye. I wish Andy would be a model infant, and dodge the
whole lot.&quot;</p>

<p>This suppositions child, born within the last few minutes,
was plainly assuming the proportions of a reality to Mr. Jaffrey.
I began to feel a little uncomfortable. I am, as I have said, a
civil engineer, and it is not strictly in my line to assist at the
births of infants, imaginary or otherwise. I pulled away vigorously
at the pipe, and said nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;What large blue eyes he has,&quot; resumed Mr. Jaffrey, after
a pause; &quot;just like Hetty's; and the fair hair, too, like hers.
How oddly certain distinctive features are handed down in
families! Sometimes a mouth, sometimes a turn of the eye-brow.
Wicked little boys over at K---- have now and then
derisively advised me to follow my nose. It would be an interesting
thing to do. I should find my nose flying about the
world, turning up unexpectedly here and there, dodging this
branch of the family and reappearing in that, now jumping
over one great-grandchild to fasten itself upon another, and
never losing its individuality. Look at Andy. There's Elkanah
Elkins's chin to the life. Andy's chin is probably older than
the Pyramids. Poor little thing,&quot; he cried, with sudden indescribable
tenderness, &quot;to lose his mother so early!&quot; And Mr.
Jaffrey's head sunk upon his breast, and his shoulders slanted
forward, as if he were actually bending over the cradle of the
child. The whole gesture and attitude was so natural that it
startled me. The pipe slipped from my fingers and fell to the
floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; whispered Mr. Jaffrey, with a deprecating motion
of his hand. &quot;Andy's asleep!&quot;</p>

<p>He rose softly from the chair, and walking across the room
on tiptoe, drew down the shade at the window through which
the moonlight was streaming. Then he returned to his seat,
and remained gazing with half-closed eyes into the dropping
embers.</p>

<p>I refilled my pipe and smoked in profound silence, wondering
what would come next. But nothing came next. Mr.
Jaffrey had fallen into so brown a study that, a quarter of an
hour afterwards, when I wished him good-night and withdrew,
I do not think he noticed my departure.</p>

<p>I am not what is called a man of imagination; it is my
habit to exclude most things not capable of mathematical
demonstration: but I am not without a certain psychological
insight, and I think I understood Mr. Jaffrey's case. I could
easily understand how a man with an unhealthy, sensitive
nature, overwhelmed by sudden calamity, might take refuge in
some forlorn place like this old tavern, and dream his life
away. To such a man--brooding forever on what might have
been, and dwelling wholly in the realm of his fancies--the
actual world might indeed become as a dream, and nothing
seem real but his illusions. I dare say that thirteen years of
Bayley's Four-Corners would have its effect upon me; though
instead of conjuring up golden-haired children of the Madonna,
I should probably see gnomes and kobolds, and goblins engaged
in hoisting false signals and misplacing switches for midnight
express trains.</p>

<p>&quot;No doubt,&quot; I said to myself that night, as I lay in bed,
thinking over the matter, &quot;this once possible but now impossible
child is a great comfort to the old gentleman,--a greater
comfort, perhaps, than a real son would be. Maybe Andy will
vanish with the shades and mists of night, he's such an unsubstantial
infant; but if he doesn't, and Mr. Jaffrey finds pleasure
in talking to me about his son, I shall humor the old fellow.
It wouldn't be a Christian act to knock over his harmless fancy.&quot;</p>

<p>I was very impatient to see if Mr. Jaffrey's illusion would
stand the test of daylight. It did. Elkanah Elkins Andrew
Jackson Jaffrey was, so to speak, alive and kicking the next
morning. On taking his seat at the breakfast-table, Mr. Jaffrey
whispered to me that Andy had had a comfortable night.</p>

<p>&quot;Silas!&quot; said Mr. Sewell, sharply, &quot;what are you whispering
about?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Sewell was in an ill humor; perhaps he was jealous
because I had passed the evening in Mr. Jaffrey's room; but
surely Mr. Sewell could not expect his boarders to go to bed at
eight o'clock every night, as he did. From time to time during
the meal Mr. Sewell regarded me unkindly out of the corner of
his eye, and in helping me to the parsnips he poniarded them
with quite a suggestive air. All this, however, did not prevent
me from repairing to the door of Mr. Jaffrey's snuggery when
night came.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mr. Jaffrey, how's Andy this evening?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Got a tooth!&quot; cried Mr. Jaffrey, vivaciously.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he has! Just through. Give the nurse a silver dollar.
Standing reward for first tooth.&quot;</p>

<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to express surprise that an
infant a day old should cut a tooth, when I suddenly recollected
that Richard III. was born with teeth. Feeling myself to be on
unfamiliar ground, I suppressed my criticism. It was well I
did so, for in the next breath I was advised that half a year
had elapsed since the previous evening.</p>

<p>&quot;Andy's had a hard six months of it,&quot; said Mr. Jaffrey, with
the well-known narrative air of fathers. &quot;We've brought him
up by hand. His grandfather, by the way, was brought up by
the bottle--&quot; and brought down by it, too, I added mentally,
recalling Mr. Sewell's account of the old gentleman's tragic
end.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaffrey then went on to give me a history of Andy's
first six months, omitting no detail however insignificant or
irrelevant. This history I would in turn inflict upon the reader,
if I were only certain that he is one of those dreadful parents
who, under the aegis of friendship, bore you at a street-corner
with that remarkable thing which Freddy said the other day,
and insist on singing to you, at an evening party, the Iliad of
Tommy's woes.</p>

<p>But to inflict this <i>enfantillage</i> upon the unmarried reader
would be an act of wanton cruelty. So I pass over that part
of Andy's biography, and for the same reason make no record
of the next four or five interviews I had with Mr. Jaffrey. It
will be sufficient to state that Andy glided from extreme
infancy to early youth with astonishing celerity--at the rate
of one year per night, if I remember correctly; and--must I
confess it?--before the week came to an end, this invisible
hobgoblin of a boy was only little less of a reality to me than
to Mr. Jaffrey.</p>

<p>At first I had lent myself to the old dreamer's whim with a
keen perception of the humor of the thing; but by and by I
found that I was talking and thinking of Miss Mehetabel's son
as though he were a veritable personage. Mr. Jaffrey spoke of
the child with such an air of conviction!--as if Andy were
playing among his toys in the next room, or making mud-pies
down in the yard. In these conversations, it should be
observed, the child was never supposed to be present, except
on that single occasion when Mr. Jaffrey leaned over the
cradle. After one of our <i>s&eacute;ances</i> I would lie awake until the
small hours, thinking of the boy, and then fall asleep only to
have indigestible dreams about him. Through the day, and
sometimes in the midst of complicated calculations, I would
catch myself wondering what Andy was up to now! There was
no shaking him off; he became an inseparable nightmare to me;
and I felt that if I remained much longer at Bayley's Four-Corners
I should turn into just such another bald-headed, mild-eyed
visionary as Silas Jaffrey.</p>

<p>Then the tavern was a grewsome old shell any way, full of
unaccountable noises after dark--rustlings of garments along
unfrequented passages, and stealthy footfalls in unoccupied
chambers overhead. I never knew of an old house without
these mysterious noises. Next to my bedroom was a musty,
dismantled apartment, in one corner of which, leaning against
the wainscot, was a crippled mangle, with its iron crank tilted
in the air like the elbow of the late Mr. Clem Jaffrey. Sometimes,</p>

<blockquote>&quot;In the dead vast and middle of the night,&quot;</blockquote>

<p>I used to hear sounds as if some one were turning that rusty
crank on the sly. This occurred only on particularly cold
nights, and I conceived the uncomfortable idea that it was the
thin family ghosts, from the neglected graveyard in the cornfield,
keeping themselves warm by running each other through
the mangle. There was a haunted air about the whole place
that made it easy for me to believe in the existence of a phantasm
like Miss Mehetabel's son, who, after all, was less unearthly
than Mr. Jaffrey himself, and seemed more properly an
inhabitant of this globe than the toothless ogre who kept the
inn, not to mention the silent Witch of Endor that cooked our
meals for us over the bar-room fire.</p>

<p>In spite of the scowls and winks bestowed upon me by Mr.
Sewell, who let slip no opportunity to testify his disapprobation
of the intimacy, Mr. Jaffrey and I spent all our evenings together--those
long autumnal evenings, through the length of
which he talked about the boy, laying out his path in life and
hedging the path with roses. He should be sent to the High
School at Portsmouth, and then to college; he should be educated
like a gentleman, Andy.</p>

<p>&quot;When the old man dies,&quot; remarked Mr. Jaffrey one night,
rubbing his hands gleefully, as if it were a great joke, &quot;Andy
will find that the old man has left him a pretty plum.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think of having Andy enter West Point, when
he's old enough?&quot; said Mr. Jaffrey on another occasion. &quot;He
needn't necessarily go into the army when he graduates; he can
become a civil engineer.&quot;</p>

<p>This was a stroke of flattery so delicate and indirect that
I could accept it without immodesty.</p>

<p>There had lately sprung up on the corner of Mr. Jaffrey's
bureau a small tin house, Gothic in architecture and pink in
color, with a slit in the roof, and the word BANK painted on
one fa&ccedil;ade. Several times in the course of an evening Mr.
Jaffrey would rise from his chair without interrupting the conversation,
and gravely drop a nickel into the scuttle of the
bank. It was pleasant to observe the solemnity of his countenance
as he approached the edifice, and the air of triumph with
which he resumed his seat by the fireplace. One night I missed
the tin bank. It had disappeared, deposits and all, like a real
bank. Evidently there had been a defalcation on rather a large
scale. I strongly suspected that Mr. Sewell was at the bottom
of it, but my suspicion was not shared by Mr. Jaffrey, who,
remarking my glance at the bureau, became suddenly depressed.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid,&quot; he said, &quot;that I have failed to instill into Andrew
those principles of integrity which--which--&quot; and the old gentleman
quite broke down.</p>

<p>Andy was now eight or nine years old, and for some time
past, if the truth must be told, had given Mr. Jaffrey no inconsiderable
trouble; what with his impishness and his illnesses, the
boy led the pair of us a lively dance. I shall not soon forget
the anxiety of Mr. Jaffrey the night Andy had the scarlet-fever--an
anxiety which so infected me that I actually returned to
the tavern the following afternoon earlier than usual, dreading
to hear that the little spectre was dead, and greatly relieved on
meeting Mr. Jaffrey at the door-step with his face wreathed in
smiles. When I spoke to him of Andy, I was made aware that
I was inquiring into a case of scarlet-fever that had occurred
the year before!</p>

<p>It was at this time, towards the end of my second week at
Greenton, that I noticed what was probably not a new trait--Mr.
Jaffrey's curious sensitiveness to atmospherical changes. He
was as sensitive as a barometer. The approach of a storm
sent his mercury down instantly. When the weather was fair
he was hopeful and sunny, and Andy's prospects were brilliant.
When the weather was overcast and threatening he grew restless
and despondent, and was afraid that the boy was not going
to turn out well.</p>

<p>On the Saturday previous to my departure, which had been
fixed for Monday, it rained heavily all the afternoon, and that
night Mr. Jaffrey was in an unusually excitable and unhappy
frame of mind. His mercury was very low indeed.</p>

<p>&quot;That boy is going to the dogs just as fast as he can go,&quot;
said Mr. Jaffrey, with a woeful face. &quot;I can't do anything with
him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He'll come out all right, Mr. Jaffrey. Boys will be boys.
I would not give a snap for a lad without animal spirits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But animal spirits,&quot; said Mr. Jaffrey sententiously, &quot;shouldn't
saw off the legs of the piano in Tobias's best parlor. I don't
know what Tobias will say when he finds it out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! has Andy sawed off the legs of the old spinet?&quot; I
returned, laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Worse than that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Played upon it, then!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir. He has lied to me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't believe that of Andy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lied to me, sir,&quot; repeated Mr. Jaffrey, severely. &quot;He
pledged me his word of honor that he would give over his
climbing. The way that boy climbs sends a chill down my
spine. This morning, notwithstanding his solemn promise, he
shinned up the lightning-rod attached to the extension, and sat
astride the ridge-pole. I saw him, and he denied it! When a
boy you have caressed and indulged and lavished pocket-money
on lies to you and <i>will</i> climb, then there's nothing more to be
said. He's a lost child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You take too dark a view of it, Mr. Jaffrey. Training and
education are bound to tell in the end, and he has been well
brought up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I didn't bring him up on a lightning-rod, did I? If
he is ever going to know how to behave, he ought to know
now. To-morrow he will be eleven years old.&quot;</p>

<p>The reflection came to me that if Andy had not been
brought up by the rod, he had certainly been brought up by
the lightning. He was eleven years old in two weeks!</p>

<p>I essayed, with that perspicacious wisdom which seems to be
the peculiar property of bachelors and elderly maiden ladies, to
tranquillize Mr. Jaffrey's mind, and to give him some practical
hints on the management of youth.</p>

<p>&quot;Spank him,&quot; I suggested at last.</p>

<p>&quot;I will!&quot; said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&quot;And you'd better do it at once!&quot; I added, as it flashed
upon me that in six months Andy would be a hundred and
forty-three years old!--an age at which parental discipline
would have to be relaxed.</p>

<p>The next morning, Sunday, the rain came down as if determined
to drive the quicksilver entirely out of my poor friend.
Mr. Jaffrey sat bolt upright at the breakfast-table, looking as
woe-begone as a bust of Dante, and retired to his chamber the
moment the meal was finished. As the day advanced, the wind
veered round to the northeast, and settled itself down to work.
It was not pleasant to think, and I tried not to think, what
Mr. Jaffrey's condition would be if the weather did not mend
its manners by noon; but so far from clearing off at noon, the
storm increased in violence, and as night set in, the wind
whistled in a spiteful falsetto key, and the rain lashed the old
tavern as if it were a balky horse that refused to move on.
The windows rattled in the worm-eaten frames, and the doors
of remote rooms, where nobody ever went, slammed to in the
maddest way. Now and then the tornado, sweeping down the
side of Mount Agamenticus, bowled across the open country, and
struck the ancient hostelry point-blank.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaffrey did not appear at supper. I knew that he was
expecting me to come to his room as usual, and I turned over
in my mind a dozen plans to evade seeing him that night. The
landlord sat at the opposite side of the chimney-place, with his
eye upon me. I fancy he was aware of the effect of this storm
on his other boarder; for at intervals, as the wind hurled itself
against the exposed gable, threatening to burst in the windows,
Mr. Sewell tipped me an atrocious wink, and displayed his
gums in a way he had not done since the morning after my
arrival at Greenton. I wondered if he suspected anything about
Andy. There had been odd times during the past week when
I felt convinced that the existence of Miss Mehetabel's son was
no secret to Mr. Sewell.</p>

<p>In deference to the gale, the landlord sat up half an hour
later than was his custom. At half-past eight he went to
bed, remarking that he thought the old pile would stand till
morning.</p>

<p>He had been absent only a few minutes when I heard a
rustling at the door. I looked up, and beheld Mr. Jaffrey
standing on the threshold, with his dress in disorder, his scant
hair flying, and the wildest expression on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;He's gone!&quot; cried Mr. Jaffrey.</p>

<p>&quot;Who? Sewell? Yes, he just went to bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not Tobias--the boy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, run away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No--he is dead! He has fallen from a step-ladder in the
red chamber and broken his neck!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Jaffrey threw up his hands with a gesture of despair,
and disappeared. I followed him through the hall, saw him go
into his own apartment, and heard the bolt of the door drawn
to. Then I returned to the bar-room, and sat for an hour or
two in the ruddy glow of the fire, brooding over the strange
experience of the last fortnight.</p>

<p>On my way to bed I paused at Mr. Jaffrey's door, and in
a lull of the storm, the measured respiration within told me
that the old gentleman was sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>Slumber was coy with me that night. I lay listening to the
soughing of the wind, and thinking of Mr. Jaffrey's illusion.
It had amused me at first with its grotesqueness; but now the
poor little phantom was dead, I was conscious that there had
been something pathetic in it all along. Shortly after midnight
the wind sunk down, coming and going fainter and
fainter, floating around the eaves of the tavern with an undulating,
murmurous sound, as if it were turning itself into soft
wings to bear away the spirit of a little child.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing that happened during my stay at Bayley's
Four-Corners took me so completely by surprise as Mr. Jaffrey's
radiant countenance the next morning. The morning itself was
not fresher or sunnier. His round face literally shone with
geniality and happiness. His eyes twinkled like diamonds, and
the magnetic light of his hair was turned on full. He came
into my room while I was packing my valise. He chirped, and
prattled, and caroled, and was sorry I was going away--but
never a word about Andy. However, the boy had probably
been dead several years then!</p>

<p>The open wagon that was to carry me to the station stood at
the door; Mr. Sewell was placing my case of instruments under
the seat, and Mr. Jaffrey had gone up to his room to get me a
certain newspaper containing an account of a remarkable shipwreck
on the Auckland Islands. I took the opportunity to
thank Mr. Sewell for his courtesies to me, and to express my
regret at leaving him and Mr. Jaffrey.</p>

<p>&quot;I have become very much attached to Mr. Jaffrey,&quot; I said;
&quot;he is a most interesting person; but that hypothetical boy of
his, that son of Miss Mehetabel's--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know!&quot; interrupted Mr. Sewell, testily. &quot;Fell off a
step-ladder and broke his dratted neck. Eleven year old, wasn't
he? Always does, jest at that point. Next week Silas will
begin the whole thing over again, if he can get anybody to
listen to him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Our amiable friend is a little queer on that subject.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Sewell glanced cautiously over his shoulder, and tapping
himself significantly on the forehead, said in a low voice,--</p>

<p>&quot;Room To Let--Unfurnished!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="ALEARDO_ALEARDI"></a>ALEARDO ALEARDI</h2>

<h3>(1812-1878)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he Italian patriot and poet, Aleardo Aleardi, was born in the
village of San Giorgio, near Verona, on November 4th, 1812.
He passed his boyhood on his father's farm, amid the
grand scenery of the valley of the Adige, which deeply impressed
itself on his youthful imagination and left its traces in all his verse.
He went to school at Verona, where for his dullness he was nick-named
the &quot;mole,&quot; and afterwards he passed on to the University of
Padua to study law, apparently to please his father, for in the
charming autobiography prefixed to his collected poems he quotes
his father as saying:--&quot;My son, be not enamored of this coquette,
Poesy; for with all her airs of a great lady, she will play thee some
trick of a faithless grisette. Choose a good companion, as one might
say, for instance the law: and thou wilt found a family; wilt partake
of God's bounties; wilt be content in life, and die quietly and
happily.&quot; In addition to satisfying his father, the young poet also
wrote at Padua his first political poems. And this brought him
into slight conflict with the authorities. He practiced law for a
short time at Verona, and wrote his first long poem, 'Arnaldo,' published
in 1842, which was very favorably received. When six years
later the new Venetian republic came into being, Aleardi was sent
to represent its interests at Paris. The speedy overthrow of the new
State brought the young ambassador home again, and for the next
ten years he worked for Italian unity and freedom. He was twice
imprisoned, at Mantua in 1852, and again in 1859 at Verona, where
he died April 17th, 1878.</p>

<p>Like most of the Italian poets of this century, Aleardi found his
chief inspiration in the exciting events that marked the struggle of
Italy for independence, and his best work antedated the peace of
Villafranca. His first serious effort was 'Le Prime Storie' (The Primal
Histories), written in 1845. In this he traces the story of the
human race from the creation through the Scriptural, classical, and
feudal periods down to the present century, and closes with foreshadowings
of a peaceful and happy future. It is picturesque, full of
lofty imagery and brilliant descriptive passages.</p>

<p>'Una Ora della mia Giovinezza' (An Hour of My Youth: 1858)
recounts many of his youthful trials and disappointments as a patriot.
Like the 'Primal Histories,' this poem is largely contemplative and
philosophical, and shines by the same splendid diction and luxurious
imagery; but it is less wide-reaching in its interests and more
specific in its appeal to his own countrymen. And from this time
onward the patriotic qualities in Aleardi's poetry predominate, and
his themes become more and more exclusively Italian. The 'Monte
Circello' sings the glories and events of the Italian land and history,
and successfully presents many facts of science in poetic form, while
the singer passionately laments the present condition of Italy. In
'Le Citta Italiane Marinore e Commercianti' (The Marine and Commercial
Cities of Italy) the story of the rise, flourishing, and fall of
Venice, Florence, Pisa, and Genoa is recounted. His other noteworthy
poems are 'Rafaello e la Fornarina,' 'Le Tre Fiume' (The
Three Rivers), 'Le Tre Fanciulle' (The Three Maidens: 1858), 'I Sette
Soldati' (The Seven Soldiers: 1859), and 'Canto Politico' (Political
Songs: 1862).</p>

<p>A slender volume of five hundred pages contains all that Aleardi
has written. Yet he is one of the chief minor Italian poets of this
century, because of his loftiness of purpose and felicity of expression,
his tenderness of feeling, and his deep sympathies with his struggling
country.</p>

<p>&quot;He has,&quot; observes Howells in his 'Modern Italian Poets,' &quot;in
greater degree than any other Italian poet of this, or perhaps of any
age, those merits which our English taste of this time demands,--quickness
of feeling and brilliancy of expression. He lacks simplicity
of idea, and his style is an opal which takes all lights and hues,
rather than the crystal which lets the daylight colorlessly through.
He is distinguished no less by the themes he selects than by the
expression he gives them. In his poetry there is passion, but his
subjects are usually those to which love is accessory rather than
essential; and he cares better to sing of universal and national destinies
as they concern individuals, than the raptures and anguishes
of youthful individuals as they concern mankind.&quot; He was original
in his way; his attitude toward both the classic and the romantic
schools is shown in the following passage from his autobiography,
which at the same time brings out his patriotism. He says:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It seemed to me strange, on the one hand, that people who, in their
serious moments and in the recesses of their hearts, invoked Christ, should
in the recesses of their minds, in the deep excitement of poetry, persist in
invoking Apollo and Pallas Minerva. It seemed to me strange, on the other
hand, that people born in Italy, with this sun, with these nights, with so
many glories, so many griefs, so many hopes at home, should have the mania
of singing the mists of Scandinavia, and the Sabbaths of witches, and
should go mad for a gloomy and dead feudalism, which had come from the
North, the highway of our misfortunes. It seemed to me, moreover, that
every Art of Poetry was marvelously useless, and that certain rules were
mummies embalmed by the hand of pedants. In fine, it seemed to me that
there were two kinds of Art: the one, serene with an Olympic serenity, the
Art of all ages that belongs to no country; the other, more impassioned, that
has its roots in one's native soil.... The first that of Homer, of Phidias,
of Virgil, of Tasso; the other that of the Prophets, of Dante, of Shakespeare,
of Byron. And I have tried to cling to this last, because I was pleased to
see how these great men take the clay of their own land and their own time,
and model from it a living statue, which resembles their contemporaries.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>In another interesting passage he explains that his old drawing-master
had in vain pleaded with the father to make his son a painter,
and he continues:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Not being allowed to use the pencil, I have used the pen. And precisely
on this account my pen resembles too much a pencil; precisely on this
account I am often too much of a naturalist, and am too fond of losing
myself in minute details. I am as one who in walking goes leisurely along,
and stops every minute to observe the dash of light that breaks through the
trees of the woods, the insect that alights on his hand, the leaf that falls on
his head, a cloud, a wave, a streak of smoke; in fine, the thousand accidents
that make creation so rich, so various, so poetical, and beyond which we evermore
catch glimpses of that grand mysterious something, eternal, immense,
benignant, and never inhuman nor cruel, as some would have us believe,
which is called God.&quot;

<h2><a name="JEAN_LE_ROND_D'ALEMBERT"></a>JEAN LE ROND D'ALEMBERT</h2>

<h3>(1717-1783)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ean Le Rond D'Alembert, one of the most noted of the
&quot;Encyclopedists,&quot; a mathematician of the first order, and
an eminent man of letters, was born at Paris in 1717. The
unacknowleged son of the Chevalier Destouches and of Mme. de Tencin,
he had been exposed on the steps of the chapel St. Jean-le-Rond,
near Notre-Dame. He was named after the place where he was
found; the surname of D'Alembert being added by himself in later
years. He was given into the care of the wife of a glazier, who
brought him up tenderly and whom he
never ceased to venerate as his true
mother. His anonymous father, however,
partly supported him by an annual income
of twelve hundred francs. He was
educated at the college Mazarin, and surprised
his Jansenist teachers by his brilliance
and precocity. They believed him
to be a second Pascal; and, doubtless to
complete the analogy, drew his attention
away from his theological studies to geometry.
But they calculated without their
host; for the young student suddenly
found out his genius, and mathematics
and the exact sciences henceforth became
his absorbing interests. He studied successively law and medicine,
but finding no satisfaction in either of these professions, with the
true instincts of the scholar he chose poverty with liberty to pursue
the studies he loved. He astonished the scientific world by his
first published works, 'Memoir on the Integral Calculus' (1739) and
'On the Refraction of Solid Bodies' (1741); and while not yet twenty-four
years old, the brilliant young mathematician was made a member
of the French Academy of Sciences. In 1754 he entered the Acad&eacute;mie
Fran&ccedil;aise, and eighteen years later became its perpetual secretary.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/374.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>D'Alembert wrote many and important works on physics and
mathematics. One of these, 'Memoir on the General Cause of
Winds,' carried away a prize from the Academy of Sciences of
Berlin, in 1746, and its dedication to Frederick II. of Prussia won him
the friendship of that monarch. But his claims to a place in French
literature, leaving aside his eulogies on members of the French
Academy deceased between 1700 and 1772, are based chiefly on his
writings in connection with the 'Encyclop&eacute;die.' Associated with
Diderot in this vast enterprise, he was at first, because of his
eminent position in the scientific world, its director and official head.
He contributed a large number of scientific and philosophic articles,
and took entire charge of the revising of the mathematical division.
His most noteworthy contribution, however, is the 'Preliminary Discourse'
prefixed as a general introduction and explanation of the
work. In this he traced with wonderful clearness and logical precision
the successive steps of the human mind in its search after
knowledge, and basing his conclusion on the historical evolution of the
race, he sketched in broad outlines the development of the sciences
and arts. In 1758 he withdrew from the active direction of the
'Encyclop&eacute;die,' that he might free himself from the annoyance of
governmental interference, to which the work was constantly subjected
because of the skeptical tendencies it evinced. But he continued to
contribute mathematical articles, with a few on other topics. One of
these, on 'Geneva,' involved him in his celebrated dispute with Rousseau
and other radicals in regard to Calvinism and the suppression
of theatrical performances in the stronghold of Swiss orthodoxy.</p>

<p>His fame was spreading over Europe. Frederick the Great of
Prussia repeatedly offered him the presidency of the Academy of
Sciences of Berlin. But he refused, as he also declined the magnificent
offer of Catherine of Russia to become tutor to her son, at a
yearly salary of a hundred thousand francs. Pope Benedict XIV.
honored him by recommending him to the membership of the Institute
of Bologne; and the high esteem in which he was held in England
is shown by the legacy of &pound;200 left him by David Hume.</p>

<p>All these honors and distinctions did not affect the simplicity of
his life, for during thirty years he continued to reside in the poor
and incommodious quarters of his foster-mother, whom he partly
supported out of his small income. Ill health at last drove him to
seek better accommodations. He had formed a romantic attachment
for Mademoiselle de l'Espinasse, and lived with her in the same
house for years unscandaled. Her death in 1776 plunged him into
profound grief. He died nine years later, on the 9th of October, 1783.</p>

<p>His manner was plain and at times almost rude; he had great
independence of character, but also much simplicity and benevolence.
With the other French deists, D'Alembert has been attacked for his
religious opinions, but with injustice. He was prudent in the public
expression of them, as the time necessitated; but he makes the freest
statement of them in his correspondence with Voltaire. His literary
and philosopic works were edited by Bassange (Paris, 1891). Condorcet,
in his 'Eulogy,' gives the best account of his life and writings.</p>

<h3><a name="MONTESQUIEU"></a>MONTESQUIEU</h3>

<center>From the Eulogy published in the 'Encyclop&eacute;die'</center>
<br>

<p>The interest which good citizens are pleased to take in the
'Encyclop&eacute;die,' and the great number of men of letters
who consecrate their labors to it, authorize us to regard
this work as the most proper monument to preserve the grateful
sentiments of our country, and that respect which is due to the
memory of those celebrated men who have done it honor. Persuaded,
however, that M. de Montesquieu had a title to expect
other panegyrics, and that the public grief deserved to be described
by more eloquent pens, we should have paid his great
memory the homage of silence, had not gratitude compelled us
to speak. A benefactor to mankind by his writings, he was not
less a benefactor to this work, and at least we may place a few
lines at the base of his statue, as it were.</p>

<p>Charles de Secondat, baron of La Br&egrave;de and of Montesquieu,
late life-President of the Parliament of Bordeaux, member of the
French Academy of Sciences, of the Royal Academy and Belles-Lettres
of Prussia, and of the Royal Society of London, was
born at the castle of La Br&egrave;de, near Bordeaux, the 18th of
January, 1689, of a noble family of Guyenne. His great-great-grandfather,
John de Secondat, steward of the household to
Henry the Second, King of Navarre, and afterward to Jane,
daughter of that king, who married Antony of Bourbon, purchased
the estate of Montesquieu for the sum of ten thousand
livres, which this princess gave him by an authentic deed, as a
reward for his probity and services.</p>

<p>Henry the Third, King of Navarre, afterward Henry the
Fourth, King of France, erected the lands of Montesquieu into a
barony, in favor of Jacob de Secondat, son of John, first a gentleman
in ordinary of the bedchamber to this prince, and afterward
colonel of the regiment of Chatillon. John Gaston de
Secondat, his second son, having married a daughter of the first
president of the Parliament of Bordeaux, purchased the office of
perpetual president in this society. He had several children, one
of whom entered the service, distinguished himself, and quitted
it very early in life. This was the father of Charles de Secondat,
author of the 'Spirit of Laws.' These particulars may seem
superfluous in the eulogy of a philosopher who stands so little in
need of ancestors; but at least we may adorn their memory with
that lustre which his name reflects upon it.</p>

<p>The early promise of his genius was fulfilled in Charles de
Secondat. He discovered very soon what he desired to be, and
his father cultivated this rising genius, the object of his hope
and of his tenderness. At the age of twenty, young Montesquieu
had already prepared materials for the 'Spirit of Laws,' by a
well-digested extract from the immense body of the civil law; as
Newton had laid in early youth the foundation of his immortal
works. The study of jurisprudence, however, though less dry to
M. de Montesquieu than to most who attempt it, because he
studied it as a philosopher, did not content him. He inquired
deeply into the subjects which pertain to religion, and considered
them with that wisdom, decency, and equity, which characterize
his work.</p>

<p>A brother of his father, perpetual president of the Parliament
of Bordeaux, an able judge and virtuous citizen, the oracle of his
own society and of his province, having lost an only son, left his
fortune and his office to M. de Montesquieu.</p>

<p>Some years after, in 1722, during the king's minority, his
society employed him to present remonstrances upon occasion of
a new impost. Placed between the throne and the people, like a
respectful subject and courageous magistrate he brought the cry
of the wretched to the ears of the sovereign--a cry which, being
heard, obtained justice. Unfortunately, this success was momentary.
Scarce was the popular voice silenced before the suppressed tax
was replaced by another; but the good citizen had done his duty.</p>

<p>He was received the 3d of April, 1716, into the new academy
of Bordeaux. A taste for music and entertainment had at first
assembled its members. M. de Montesquieu believed that the
talents of his friends might be better employed in physical subjects.
He was persuaded that nature, worthy of being beheld
everywhere, could find everywhere eyes worthy to behold her;
while it was impossible to gather together, at a distance from
the metropolis, distinguished writers on works of taste. He
looked upon our provincial societies for belles-lettres as a shadow
of literature which obscures the reality. The Duke de la Force,
by a prize which he founded at Bordeaux, seconded these rational
views. It was decided that a good physical experiment would be
better than a weak discourse or a bad poem; and Bordeaux got
an Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>M. de Montesquieu, careless of reputation, wrote little. It
was not till 1721, that is to say, at thirty-two years of age, that
he published the 'Persian Letters.' The description of Oriental
manners, real or supposed, is the least important thing in these
letters. It serves merely as a pretense for a delicate satire upon
our own customs and for the concealment of a serious intention.
In this moving picture, Usbec chiefly exposes, with as much ease
as energy, whatever among us most struck his penetrating eyes:
our way of treating the silliest things seriously, and of laughing
at the most important; our way of talking which is at once so
blustering and so frivolous; our impatience even in the midst of
pleasure itself; our prejudices and our actions that perpetually
contradict our understandings; our great love of glory and respect
for the idol of court favor, our little real pride; our courtiers so
mean and vain; our exterior politeness to, and our real contempt
of strangers; our fantastical tastes, than which there is nothing
lower but the eagerness of all Europe to adopt them; our barbarous
disdain for the two most respectable occupations of a
citizen--commerce and magistracy; our literary disputes, so keen
and so useless; our rage for writing before we think, and for
judging before we understand. To this picture he opposes, in
the apologue of the Troglodytes, the description of a virtuous
people, become wise by misfortunes--a piece worthy of the portico.
In another place, he represents philosophy, long silenced,
suddenly reappearing, regaining rapidly the time which she had
lost; penetrating even among the Russians at the voice of a
genius which invites her; while among other people of Europe,
superstition, like a thick atmosphere, prevents the all-surrounding
light from reaching them. Finally, by his review of ancient and
modern government, he presents us with the bud of those bright
ideas since fully developed in his great work.</p>

<p>These different subjects, no longer novel, as when the 'Persian
Letters' first appeared, will forever remain original--a merit the
more real that it proceeds alone from the genius of the writer;
for Usbec acquired, during his abode in France, so perfect a
knowledge of our morals, and so strong a tincture of our manners,
that his style makes us forget his country. This small
solecism was perhaps not unintentional. While exposing our follies
and vices, he meant, no doubt, to do justice to our merits.
Avoiding the insipidity of a direct panegyric, he has more delicately
praised us by assuming our own air in professed satire.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the success of his work, M. de Montesquieu
did not acknowledge it. Perhaps he wished to escape criticism.
Perhaps he wished to avoid a contrast of the frivolity of the
'Persian Letters' with the gravity of his office; a sort of reproach
which critics never fail to make, because it requires no sort of
effort. But his secret was discovered, and the public suggested
his name for the Academy. The event justified M. de Montesquieu's
silence. Usbec expresses himself freely, not concerning
the fundamentals of Christianity, but about matters which people
affect to confound with Christianity itself: about the spirit of
persecution which has animated so many Christians; about the
temporal usurpation of ecclesiastical power; about the excessive
multiplication of monasteries, which deprive the State of subjects
without giving worshipers to God; about some opinions which
would fain be established as principles; about our religious disputes,
always violent and often fatal. If he appears anywhere to
touch upon questions more vital to Christianity itself, his reflections
are in fact favorable to revelation, because he shows how
little human reason, left to itself, knows.</p>

<p>Among the genuine letters of M. de Montesquieu the foreign
printer had inserted some by another hand. Before the author
was condemned, these should have been thrown out. Regardless
of these considerations, hatred masquerading as zeal, and zeal
without understanding, rose and united themselves against the
'Persian Letters.' Informers, a species of men dangerous and
base, alarmed the piety of the ministry. M. de Montesquieu,
urged by his friends, supported by the public voice, having
offered himself for the vacant place of M. de Sacy in the French
Academy, the minister wrote &quot;The Forty&quot; that his Majesty would
never accept the election of the author of the &quot;Persian Letters&quot;
that he had not, indeed, read the book, but that persons in whom
he placed confidence had informed him of its poisonous tendency.
M. de Montesquieu saw what a blow such an accusation might
prove to his person, his family, and his tranquillity. He neither
sought literary honors nor affected to disdain them when they
came in his way, nor did he regard the lack of them as a misfortune:
but a perpetual exclusion, and the motives of that exclusion,
appeared to him to be an injury. He saw the minister, and
explained that though he did not acknowledge the 'Persian Letters,'
he would not disown a work for which he had no reason to
blush; and that he ought to be judged upon its contents, and not
upon mere hearsay. At last the minister read the book, loved
the author, and learned wisdom as to his advisers. The French
Academy obtained one of its greatest ornaments, and France had
the happiness to keep a subject whom superstition or calumny
had nearly deprived her of; for M. de Montesquieu had declared
to the government that, after the affront they proposed, he would
go among foreigners in quest of that safety, that repose, and perhaps
those rewards which he might reasonably have expected in
his own country. The nation would really have deplored his loss,
while yet the disgrace of it must have fallen upon her.</p>

<p>M. de Montesquieu was received the 24th of January, 1728.
His oration is one of the best ever pronounced here. Among
many admirable passages which shine out in its pages is the deep-thinking
writer's characterization of Cardinal Richelieu, &quot;who
taught France the secret of its strength, and Spain that of its
weakness; who freed Germany from her chains and gave her new
ones.&quot;</p>

<p>The new Academician was the worthier of this title, that he
had renounced all other employments to give himself entirely up
to his genius and his taste. However important was his place, he
perceived that a different work must employ his talents; that the
citizen is accountable to his country and to mankind for all the
good he may do; and that he could be more useful by his writings
than by settling obscure legal disputes. He was no longer
a magistrate, but only a man of letters.</p>

<p>But that his works should serve other nations, it was necessary
that he should travel, his aim being to examine the natural
and moral world, to study the laws and constitution of every
country; to visit scholars, writers, artists, and everywhere to seek
for those rare men whose conversation sometimes supplies the
place of years of observation. M. de Montesquieu might have
said, like Democritus, &quot;I have forgot nothing to instruct myself;
I have quitted my country and traveled over the universe, the
better to know truth; I have seen all the illustrious personages of
my time.&quot; But there was this difference between the French
Democritus and him of Abdera, that the first traveled to instruct
men, and the second to laugh at them.</p>

<p>He went first to Vienna, where he often saw the celebrated
Prince Eugene. This hero, so fatal to France (to which he
might have been so useful), after having checked the advance of
Louis XIV. and humbled the Ottoman pride, lived without pomp,
loving and cultivating letters in a court where they are little
honored, and showing his masters how to protect them.</p>

<p>Leaving Vienna, the traveler visited Hungary, an opulent and
fertile country, inhabited by a haughty and generous nation, the
scourge of its tyrants and the support of its sovereigns. As few
persons know this country well, he has written with care this
part of his travels.</p>

<p>From Germany he went to Italy. At Venice he met the
famous Mr. Law, of whose former grandeur nothing remained
but projects fortunately destined to die away unorganized, and a
diamond which he pawned to play at games of hazard. One day
the conversation turned on the famous system which Law had
invented; the source of so many calamities, so many colossal fortunes,
and so remarkable a corruption in our morals. As the Parliament
of Paris had made some resistance to the Scotch minister
on this occasion, M. de Montesquieu asked him why he had never
tried to overcome this resistance by a method almost always
infallible in England, by the grand mover of human actions--in
a word, by money. &quot;These are not,&quot; answered Law, &quot;geniuses so
ardent and so generous as my countrymen; but they are much
more incorruptible.&quot; It is certainly true that a society which is
free for a limited time ought to resist corruption more than one
which is always free: the first, when it sells its liberty, loses it;
the second, so to speak, only lends it, and exercises it even when
it is thus parting with it. Thus the circumstances and nature of
government give rise to the vices and virtues of nations.</p>

<p>Another person, no less famous, whom M. de Montesquieu saw
still oftener at Venice, was Count de Bonneval. This man, so
well known for his adventures, which were not yet at an end,
delighted to converse with so good a judge and so excellent a
hearer, often related to him the military actions in which he had
been engaged, and the remarkable circumstances of his life, and
drew the characters of generals and ministers whom he had
known.</p>

<p>He went from Venice to Rome. In this ancient capital of
the world he studied the works of Raphael, of Titian, and of
Michael Angelo. Accustomed to study nature, he knew her when
she was translated, as a faithful portrait appeals to all who are
familiar with the original.</p>

<p>After having traveled over Italy, M. de Montesquieu came to
Switzerland and studied those vast countries which are watered
by the Rhine. There was the less for him to see in Germany
that Frederick did not yet reign. In the United Provinces he
beheld an admirable monument of what human industry animated
by a love of liberty can do. In England he stayed three years.
Welcomed by the greatest men, he had nothing to regret save
that he had not made his journey sooner. Newton and Locke
were dead. But he had often the honor of paying his respects to
their patroness, the celebrated Queen of England, who cultivated
philosophy upon a throne, and who properly esteemed and valued
M. de Montesquieu. Nor was he less well received by the
nation. At London he formed intimate friendships with the
great thinkers. With them he studied the nature of the government,
attaining profound knowledge of it.</p>

<p>As he had set out neither as an enthusiast nor a cynic, he
brought back neither a disdain for foreigners nor a contempt for
his own country. It was the result of his observations that Germany
was made to travel in, Italy to sojourn in, England to think
in, and France to live in.</p>

<p>After returning to his own country, M. de Montesquieu retired
for two years to his estate of La Br&egrave;de, enjoying that solitude
which a life in the tumult and hurry of the world but makes the
more agreeable. He lived with himself, after having so long
lived with others; and finished his work 'On the Cause of the
Grandeur and Decline of the Romans,' which appeared in 1734.</p>

<p>Empires, like men, must increase, decay, and be extinguished.
But this necessary revolution may have hidden causes which the
veil of time conceals from us.</p>

<p>Nothing in this respect more resembles modern history than
ancient history. That of the Romans must, however, be excepted.
It presents us with a rational policy, a connected system of
aggrandizement, which will not permit us to attribute the great fortune
of this people to obscure and inferior sources. The causes of
the Roman grandeur may then be found in history, and it is the
business of the philosopher to discover them. Besides, there are
no systems in this study, as in that of physics, which are easily
overthrown, because one new and unforeseen experiment can
upset them in an instant. On the contrary, when we carefully
collect the facts, if we do not always gather together all the
desired materials, we may at least hope one day to obtain more.
A great historian combines in the most perfect manner these
defective materials. His merit is like that of an architect, who,
from a few remains, traces the plan of an ancient edifice; supplying,
by genius and happy conjectures, what was wanting in fact.</p>

<p>It is from this point of view that we ought to consider the
work of M. de Montesquieu. He finds the causes of the grandeur
of the Romans in that love of liberty, of labor, and of country,
which was instilled into them during their infancy; in those
intestine divisions which gave an activity to their genius, and
which ceased immediately upon the appearance of an enemy; in
that constancy after misfortunes, which never despaired of the
republic; in that principle they adhered to of never making peace
but after victories; in the honor of a triumph, which was a subject
of emulation among the generals; in that protection which
they granted to those peoples who rebelled against their kings;
in the excellent policy of permitting the conquered to preserve
their religion and customs; and the equally excellent determination
never to have two enemies upon their hands at once, but to
bear everything from the one till they had destroyed the other.
He finds the causes of their declension in the aggrandizement of
the State itself: in those distant wars, which, obliging the citizens
to be too long absent, made them insensibly lose their republican
spirit; in the too easily granted privilege of being citizens of
Rome, which made the Roman people at last become a sort of
many-headed monster; in the corruption introduced by the luxury
of Asia; in the proscriptions of Sylla, which debased the genius
of the nation, and prepared it for slavery; in the necessity of
having a master while their liberty was become burdensome to
them; in the necessity of changing their maxims when they
changed their government; in that series of monsters who
reigned, almost without interruption, from Tiberius to Nerva,
and from Commodus to Constantine; lastly, in the translation
and division of the empire, which perished first in the West
by the power of barbarians, and after having languished in the
East, under weak or cruel emperors, insensibly died away, like
those rivers which disappear in the sands.</p>

<p>In a very small volume M. de Montesquieu explained and
unfolded his picture. Avoiding detail, and seizing only essentials,
he has included in a very small space a vast number of objects
distinctly perceived, and rapidly presented, without fatiguing the
reader. While he points out much, he leaves us still more to
reflect upon; and he might have entitled his book, 'A Roman
History for the Use of Statesmen and Philosophers.'</p>

<p>Whatever reputation M. de Montesquieu had thus far acquired,
he had but cleared the way for a far grander undertaking--for
that which ought to immortalize his name, and commend it to
the admiration of future ages. He had meditated for twenty
years upon its execution; or, to speak more exactly, his whole
life had been a perpetual meditation upon it. He had made
himself in some sort a stranger in his own country, the better to
understand it. He had studied profoundly the different peoples
of Europe. The famous island, which so glories in her laws, and
which makes so bad a use of them, proved to him what Crete
had been to Lycurgus--a school where he learned much without
approving everything. Thus he attained by degrees to the noblest
title a wise man can deserve, that of legislator of nations.</p>

<p>If he was animated by the importance of his subject, he was
at the same time terrified by its extent. He abandoned it, and
returned to it again and again. More than once, as he himself
owns, he felt his paternal hands fail him. At last, encouraged
by his friends, he resolved to publish the 'Spirit of Laws.'</p>

<p>In this important work M. de Montesquieu, without insisting,
like his predecessors, upon metaphysical discussions, without confining
himself, like them, to consider certain people in certain
particular relations or circumstances, takes a view of the actual
inhabitants of the world in all their conceivable relations to each
other. Most other writers in this way are either simple moralists,
or simple lawyers, or even sometimes simple theologists. As
for him, a citizen of all nations, he cares less what duty requires
of us than what means may constrain us to do it; about the
metaphysical perfection of laws, than about what man is capable
of; about laws which have been made, than about those which
ought to have been made; about the laws of a particular people,
than about those of all peoples. Thus, when comparing himself
to those who have run before him in this noble and grand
career, he might say, with Correggio, when he had seen the
works of his rivals, &quot;And I, too, am a Painter.&quot;</p>

<p>Filled with his subject, the author of the 'Spirit of Laws'
comprehends so many materials, and treats them with such brevity
and depth, that assiduous reading alone discloses its merit.
This study will make that pretended want of method, of which
some readers have accused M. de Montesquieu, disappear. Real
want of order should be distinguished from what is apparent
only. Real disorder confuses the analogy and connection of ideas;
or sets up conclusions as principles, so that the reader, after
innumerable windings, finds himself at the point whence he set
out. Apparent disorder is when the author, putting his ideas
in their true place, leaves it to the readers to supply intermediate
ones. M. de Montesquieu's book is designed for men who
think, for men capable of supplying voluntary and reasonable
omissions.</p>

<p>The order perceivable in the grand divisions of the 'Spirit
of Laws' pervades the smaller details also. By his method of
arrangement we easily perceive the influence of the different parts
upon each other; as, in a system of human knowledge well understood,
we may perceive the mutual relation of sciences and arts.
There must always remain something arbitrary in every comprehensive
scheme, and all that can be required of an author is, that
he follow strictly his own system.</p>

<p>For an allowable obscurity the same defense exists. What
may be obscure to the ignorant is not so for those whom the
author had in mind. Besides, voluntary obscurity is not properly
obscurity. Obliged to present truths of great importance, the
direct avowal of which might have shocked without doing good,
M. de Montesquieu has had the prudence to conceal them from
those whom they might have hurt without hiding them from the
wise.</p>

<p>He has especially profited from the two most thoughtful historians,
Tacitus and Plutarch; but, though a philosopher familiar
with these authors might have dispensed with many others, he
neglected nothing that could be of use. The reading necessary
for the 'Spirit of Laws' is immense; and the author's ingenuity
is the more wonderful because he was almost blind, and obliged
to depend on other men's eyes. This prodigious reading contributes
not only to the utility, but to the agreeableness of the work.
Without sacrificing dignity, M. de Montesquieu entertains the
reader by unfamiliar facts, or by delicate allusions, or by those
strong and brilliant touches which paint, by one stroke, nations
and men.</p>

<p>In a word, M. de Montesquieu stands for the study of laws, as
Descartes stood for that of philosophy. He often instructs us, and
is sometimes mistaken; and even when he mistakes, he instructs
those who know how to read him. The last edition of his works
demonstrates, by its many corrections and additions, that when he
has made a slip, he has been able to rise again.</p>

<p>But what is within the reach of all the world is the spirit of
the 'Spirit of Laws,' which ought to endear the author to all
nations, to cover far greater faults than are his. The love of the
public good, a desire to see men happy, reveals itself everywhere;
and had it no other merit, it would be worthy, on this account
alone, to be read by nations and kings. Already we may perceive
that the fruits of this work are ripe. Though M. de Montesquieu
scarcely survived the publication of the 'Spirit of Laws,' he had
the satisfaction to foresee its effects among us; the natural love of
Frenchmen for their country turned toward its true object; that
taste for commerce, for agriculture, and for useful arts, which
insensibly spreads itself in our nation; that general knowledge of
the principles of government, which renders people more attached
to that which they ought to love. Even the men who have
indecently attacked this work perhaps owe more to it than they
imagine. Ingratitude, besides, is their least fault. It is not without
regret and mortification that we expose them; but this history
is of too much consequence to M. de Montesquieu and to philosophy
to be passed over in silence. May that reproach, which at
last covers his enemies, profit them!</p>

<p>The 'Spirit of Laws' was at once eagerly sought after on
account of the reputation of its author; but though M. de Montesquieu
had written for thinkers, he had the vulgar for his judge.
The brilliant passages scattered up and down the work, admitted
only because they illustrated the subject, made the ignorant
believe that it was written for them. Looking for an entertaining
book, they found a useful one, whose scheme and details they
could not comprehend without attention. The 'Spirit of Laws'
was treated with a deal of cheap wit; even the title of it was
made a subject of pleasantry. In a word, one of the finest literary
monuments which our nation ever produced was received almost
with scurrility. It was requisite that competent judges should
have time to read it, that they might correct the errors of the
fickle multitude. That small public which teaches, dictated to
that large public which listens to hear, how it ought to think and
speak; and the suffrages of men of abilities formed only one
voice over all Europe.</p>

<p>The open and secret enemies of letters and philosophy now
united their darts against this work. Hence that multitude of
pamphlets discharged against the author, weapons which we shall
not draw from oblivion. If those authors were not forgotten, it
might be believed that the 'Spirit of Laws' was written amid a
nation of barbarians.</p>

<p>M. de Montesquieu despised the obscure criticisms of the
curious. He ranked them with those weekly newspapers whose
encomiums have no authority, and their darts no effect; which
indolent readers run over without believing, and in which sovereigns
are insulted without knowing it. But he was not equally
indifferent about those principles of irreligion which they accused
him of having propagated. By ignoring such reproaches he
would have seemed to deserve them, and the importance of the
object made him shut his eyes to the meanness of his adversaries.
The ultra-zealous, afraid of that light which letters diffuse, not to the
prejudice of religion, but to their own disadvantage, took
different ways of attacking him; some, by a trick as puerile as
cowardly, wrote fictitious letters to themselves; others, attacking
him anonymously, had afterwards fallen by the ears among themselves.
M. de Montesquieu contented himself with making an
example of the most extravagant. This was the author of an
anonymous periodical paper, who accused M. de Montesquieu of
Spinozism and deism (two imputations which are incompatible);
of having followed the system of Pope (of which there is not a
word in his works); of having quoted Plutarch, who is not a
Christian author; of not having spoken of original sin and of
grace. In a word, he pretended that the 'Spirit of Laws' was a
production of the constitution <i>Unigenitus</i>; a preposterous idea.
Those who understand M. de Montesquieu and Clement XI. may
judge, by this accusation, of the rest.</p>

<p>This enemy procured the philosopher an addition of glory as
a man of letters: the 'Defense of the Spirit of Laws' appeared.
This work, for its moderation, truth, delicacy of ridicule, is a
model. M. de Montesquieu might easily have made his adversary
odious; he did better--he made him ridiculous. We owe the
aggressor eternal thanks for having procured us this masterpiece.
For here, without intending it, the author has drawn a picture of
himself; those who knew him think they hear him; and posterity,
when reading his 'Defense,' will decide that his conversation
equaled his writings--an encomium which few great men have
deserved.</p>

<p>Another circumstance gave him the advantage. The critic
loudly accused the clergy of France, and especially the faculty of
theology, of indifference to the cause of God, because they did
not proscribe the 'Spirit of Laws.' The faculty resolved to
examine the 'Spirit of Laws.' Though several years have passed,
it has not yet pronounced a decision. It knows the grounds of
reason and of faith; it knows that the work of a man of letters
ought not to be examined like that of a theologian; that a bad
interpretation does not condemn a proposition, and that it may
injure the weak to see an ill-timed suspicion of heresy thrown
upon geniuses of the first rank. In spite of this unjust accusation,
M. de Montesquieu was always esteemed, visited, and well
received by the greatest and most respectable dignitaries of the
Church. Would he have preserved this esteem among men of
worth, if they had regarded him as a dangerous writer?</p>

<p>M. de Montesquieu's death was not unworthy of his life.
Suffering greatly, far from a family that was dear to him, surrounded
by a few friends and a great crowd of spectators, he
preserved to the last his calmness and serenity of soul. After
performing with decency every duty, full of confidence in the
Eternal Being, he died with the tranquillity of a man of worth,
who had ever consecrated his talents to virtue and humanity.
France and Europe lost him February 10th, 1755, aged sixty-six.</p>

<p>All the newspapers published this event as a misfortune. We
may apply to M. de Montesquieu what was formerly said of an
illustrious Roman: that nobody, when told of his death, showed
any joy or forgot him when he was no more. Foreigners were
eager to demonstrate their regrets: my Lord Chesterfield, whom
it is enough to name, wrote an article to his honor--an article
worthy of both. It is the portrait of Anaxagoras drawn by
Pericles. The Royal Academy of Sciences and Belles-Lettres of
Prussia, though it is not its custom to pronounce a eulogy on
foreign members, paid him an honor which only the illustrious
John Bernoulli had hitherto received. M. de Maupertuis, though
ill, performed himself this last duty to his friend, and would not
permit so sacred an office to fall to the share of any other. To
these honorable suffrages were added those praises given him,
in presence of one of us, by that very monarch to whom this
celebrated Academy owes its lustre; a prince who feels the losses
which Philosophy sustains, and at the same time comforts her.</p>

<p>The 17th of February the French Academy, according to
custom, performed a solemn service for him, at which all the
learned men of this body assisted. They ought to have placed
the 'Spirit of Laws' upon his coffin, as heretofore they exposed,
opposite to that of Raphael, his Transfiguration. This simple and
affecting decoration would have been a fit funeral oration.</p>

<p>M. de Montesquieu had, in company, an unvarying sweetness
and gayety of temper. His conversation was spirited, agreeable,
and instructive, because he had known so many great men. It
was, like his style, concise, full of wit and sallies, without gall,
and without satire. Nobody told a story more brilliantly, more
readily, more gracefully, or with less affectation.</p>

<p>His frequent absence of mind only made him the more amusing.
He always roused himself to reanimate the conversation.
The fire of his genius, his prodigality of ideas, gave rise to
flashes of speech; but he never interrupted an interesting conversation;
and he was attentive without affectation and without constraint.
His conversation not only resembled his character and
his genius, but had the method which he observed in his study.
Though capable of long-continued meditation, he never exhausted
his strength; he always left off application before he felt the
least symptom of fatigue.</p>

<p>He was sensible to glory, but wished only to deserve it, and
never tried to augment his own fame by underhand practices.</p>

<p>Worthy of all distinctions, he asked none, and he was not
surprised that he was forgot; but he has protected at court men
of letters who were persecuted, celebrated, and unfortunate, and
has obtained favors for them.</p>

<p>Though he lived with the great, their company was not
necessary to his happiness. He retired whenever he could to the
country; there again with joy to welcome his philosophy, his
books, and his repose. After having studied man in the commerce
of the world, and in the history of nations, he studied him
also among those simple people whom nature alone has instructed.
From them he could learn something; he endeavored,
like Socrates, to find out their genius; he appeared as happy
thus as in the most brilliant assemblies, especially when he made
up their differences, and comforted them by his beneficence.</p>

<p>Nothing does greater honor to his memory than the economy
with which he lived, and which has been blamed as excessive in
a proud and avaricious age. He would not encroach on the provision
for his family, even by his generosity to the unfortunate,
or by those expenses which his travels, the weakness of his sight,
and the printing of his works made necessary. He transmitted
to his children, without diminution or augmentation, the estate
which he received from his ancestors, adding nothing to it but
the glory of his name and the example of his life. He had
married, in 1715, dame Jane de Lartigue, daughter of Peter de
Lartigue, lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of Molevrier, and
had by her two daughters and one son.</p>

<p>Those who love truth and their country will not be displeased
to find some of his maxims here. He thought: That every part
of the State ought to be equally subject to the laws, but that the
privileges of every part of the State ought to be respected when
they do not oppose the natural right which obliges every citizen
equally to contribute to the public good; that ancient possession
was in this kind the first of titles, and the most inviolable of
rights, which it was always unjust and sometimes dangerous to
shake; that magistrates, in all circumstances, and notwithstanding
their own advantage, ought to be magistrates without partiality
and without passion, like the laws which absolve and
punish without love or hatred. He said upon occasion of those
ecclesiastical disputes which so much employed the Greek emperors
and Christians, that theological disputes, when they are not
confined to the schools, infallibly dishonor a nation in the eyes
of its neighbors: in fact, the contempt in which wise men hold
those quarrels does not vindicate the character of their country;
because, sages making everywhere the least noise, and being the
smallest number, it is never from them that the nation is judged.</p>

<p>We look upon that special interest which M. de Montesquieu
took in the (Encyclopedic) as one of the most honorable rewards
of our labor. Perhaps the opposition which the work has met
with, reminding him of his own experience, interested him the
more in our favor. Perhaps he was sensible, without perceiving
it, of that justice which we dared to do him in the first volume
of the 'Encyclopedic,' when nobody as yet had ventured to say a
word in his defense. He prepared for us an article upon 'Taste,'
which has been found unfinished among his papers. We shall
give it to the public in that condition, and treat it with the same
respect that antiquity formerly showed to the last words of
Seneca. Death prevented his giving us any further marks of his
approval; and joining our own griefs with those of all Europe,
we might write on his tomb:--</p>

<h3>(1749-1803)</h3>

<h3>BY L. OSCAR KUHNS</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-i.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>talian literature during the eighteenth century, although it
could boast of no names in any way comparable with those
of Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, and Tasso, showed still a vast
improvement on the degradation of the preceding century. Among
the most famous writers of the times--Goldoni, Parini, Metastasio--none
is so great or so famous as Vittorio Alfieri, the founder of Italian
tragedy. The story of his life and of his literary activity, as
told by himself in his memoirs, is one of extreme interest. Born at
Asti, on January 17th, 1749, of a wealthy and noble family, he grew
up to manhood singularly deficient in knowledge and culture, and
without the slightest interest in literature. He was &quot;uneducated,&quot;
to use his own phrase, in the Academy of Turin. It was only after a
long tour in Italy, France, Holland, and England, that, recognizing
his own ignorance, he went to Florence to begin serious work.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-seven a sudden revelation of his dramatic
power came to him, and with passionate energy he spent the rest of
his life in laborious study and in efforts to make himself worthy of
a place among the poets of his native land. Practically he had to
learn everything; for he himself tells us that he had &quot;an almost
total ignorance of the rules of dramatic composition, and an unskillfulness
almost total in the divine and most necessary art of writing
well and handling his own language.&quot;</p>

<p>His private life was eventful, chiefly through his many sentimental
attachments, its deepest experience being his profound love
and friendship for the Countess of Albany,--Louise Stolberg, mistress
and afterward wife of the &quot;Young Pretender,&quot; who passed under the
title of Count of Albany, and from whom she was finally divorced.
The production of Alfieri's tragedies began with the sketch called
'Cleopatra,' in 1775, and lasted till 1789, when a complete edition, by
Didot, appeared in Paris. His only important prose work is his
'Auto-biography' begun in 1790 and ended in the year of his death, 1803.
Although he wrote several comedies and a number of sonnets and
satires,--which do not often rise above mediocrity,--it is as a tragic
poet that he is known to fame. Before him--though Goldoni had
successfully imitated Moli&egrave;re in comedy, and Metastasio had become
enormously popular as the poet of love and the opera--no tragedies
had been written in Italy which deserved to be compared with the
great dramas of France, Spain, and England. Indeed, it had been
said that tragedy was not adapted to the Italian tongue or character.
It remained for Alfieri to prove the falsity of this theory.</p>

<p>Always sensitive to the charge of plagiarism, Alfieri declared that
whether his tragedies were good or bad, they were at least his own.
This is true to a certain extent. And yet he was influenced more
than he was willing to acknowledge by the French dramatists of the
seventeenth century. In common with Corneille and Racine, he observed
strictly the three unities of time, place, and action. But the
courtliness of language, the grace and poetry of the French dramas,
and especially the tender love of Racine, are altogether lacking with
him.</p>

<p>Alfieri had a certain definite theory of tragedy which he followed
with unswerving fidelity. He aimed at the simplicity and directness
of the Greek drama. He sought to give one clear, definite action,
which should advance in a straight line from beginning to end, without
deviation, and carry along the characters--who are, for the most
part, helplessly entangled in the toils of a relentless fate--to an
inevitable destruction. For this reason the well-known <i>confidantes</i> of
the French stage were discarded, no secondary action or episodes
were admitted, and the whole play was shortened to a little more
than two-thirds of the average French classic drama. Whatever
originality Alfieri possessed did not show itself in the choice of
subjects, which are nearly all well known and had often been used
before. From Racine he took 'Polynice,' 'Merope' had been treated
by Maffei and Voltaire, and Shakespeare had immortalized the story
of Brutus. The situations and events are often conventional; the
passions are those familiar to the stage,--jealousy, revenge, hatred,
and unhappy love. And yet Alfieri has treated these subjects in a
way which differs from all others, and which stamps them, in a certain
sense, as his own. With him all is sombre and melancholy; the
scene is utterly unrelieved by humor, by the flowers of poetry, or by
that deep-hearted sympathy--the pity of it all--which softens the
tragic effect of Shakespeare's plays.</p>

<p>Alfieri seemed to be attracted toward the most horrible phases of
human life, and the most terrible events of history and tradition.
The passions he describes are those of unnatural love, of jealousy
between father and son, of fratricidal hatred, or those in which a
sense of duty and love for liberty triumphs over the ties of filial
and parental love. In treating the story of the second Brutus, it
was not enough for his purpose to have Caesar murdered by his
friend; but, availing himself of an unproven tradition, he makes Brutus
the son of Caesar, and thus a parricide.</p>

<br>
<a name="393.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/393.jpg" width="40%" alt="">
</p><br>

<p>It is interesting to notice his vocabulary; to see how constantly
he uses such words as &quot;atrocious,&quot; &quot;horror,&quot; &quot;terrible,&quot; &quot;incest,&quot;
&quot;rivers,&quot; &quot;streams,&quot; &quot;lakes,&quot; and &quot;seas&quot; of blood. The exclamation,
&quot;Oh, rage&quot; occurs on almost every page. Death, murder,
suicide, is the outcome of every tragedy.</p>

<p>The actors are few,--in many plays only four,--and each represents
a certain passion. They never change, but remain true to
their characters from beginning to end. The villains are monsters
of cruelty and vice, and the innocent and virtuous are invariably
their victims, and succumb at last.</p>

<p>Alfieri's purpose in producing these plays was not to amuse an
idle public, but to promulgate throughout his native land--then
under Spanish domination--the great and lofty principle of liberty
which inspired his whole life. A deep, uncompromising hatred of
kings is seen in every drama, where invariably a tyrant figures as
the villain. There is a constant declamation against tyranny and
slavery. Liberty is portrayed as something dearer than life itself.
The struggle for freedom forms the subjects of five of his
plays,--'Virginia,' 'The Conspiracy of the Pazzi,' 'Timoleon,' the
'First Brutus,' and the 'Second Brutus.' One of these is dedicated to
George Washington--'Liberator dell' America.' The warmth of
feeling with which, in the 'Conspiracy of the Pazzi,' the degradation
and slavery of Florence under the Medici is depicted, betrays
clearly Alfieri's sense of the political state of Italy in his own day.
And the poet undoubtedly has gained the gratitude of his countrymen
for his voicing of that love for liberty which has always existed
in their hearts.</p>

<p>Just as Alfieri sought to condense the action of his plays, so he
strove for brevity and condensation in language. His method of
composing was peculiar. He first sketched his play in prose, then
worked it over in poetry, often spending years in the process of
rewriting and polishing. In his indomitable energy, his persistence
in labor, and his determination to acquire a fitting style, he reminds
us of Balzac. His brevity of language--which shows itself most
strikingly in the omission of articles, and in the number of broken
exclamations--gives his pages a certain sententiousness, almost like
proverbs. He purposely renounced all attempts at the graces and
flowers of poetry.</p>

<p>It is hard for the lover of Shakespearean tragedy to be just to
the merits of Alfieri. There is a uniformity, or even a monotony,
in these nineteen plays, whose characters are more or less alike,
whose method of procedure is the same, whose sentiments are
analogous, and in which an activity devoid of incident hurries the
reader to an inevitable conclusion, foreseen from the first act.</p>

<p>And yet the student cannot fail to detect great tragic power,
sombre and often unnatural, but never producing that sense of the
ridiculous which sometimes mars the effect of Victor Hugo's dramas.
The plots are never obscure, the language is never trivial, and the
play ends with a climax which leaves a profound impression.</p>

<p>The very nature of Alfieri's tragedies makes it difficult to represent
him without giving a complete play. The following extracts,
however, illustrate admirably the horror and power of his climaxes.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aegis</i>.--How canst thou<br>
Of me demand it?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly.</i>--What then may it be? ...<br>
I know not ... Speak: I am too far advanced;<br>
I cannot now retract: perchance already<br>
I am suspected by Atrides; maybe<br>
He has the right already to despise me:<br>
Hence do I feel constrained, e'en now, to hate him;<br>
I cannot longer in his presence live;<br>
I neither will, nor dare.--Do thou, Aegisthus,<br>
Teach me a means, whatever it may be,<br>
A means by which I may withdraw myself<br>
From him forever.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--Thou withdraw thyself<br>
From him? I have already said to thee<br>
That now 'tis utterly impossible.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly.</i>--What other step remains for me to take? ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aegis.</i>--None.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Cly.</i>--Now I understand thee.--What a flash.<br>
Oh, what a deadly, instantaneous flash<br>
Of criminal conviction rushes through<br>
My obtuse mind! What throbbing turbulence<br>
In ev'ry vein I feel!--I understand thee:<br>
The cruel remedy ... the only one ...<br>
Is Agamemnon's life-blood.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--I am silent ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly.</i>--Yet, by thy silence, thou dost ask that blood.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aegis.</i>--Nay, rather I forbid it.--To our love<br>
And to thy life (of mine I do not speak)<br>
His living is the only obstacle;<br>
But yet, thou knowest that his life is sacred:<br>
To love, respect, defend it, thou art bound;<br>
And I to tremble at it.--Let us cease:<br>
The hour advances now; my long discourse<br>
Might give occasion to suspicious thoughts.--<br>
At length receive ... Aegisthus's last farewell.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly.</i>--Ah! hear me ... Agamemnon to our love ...<br>
And to thy life? ... Ah, yes; there are, besides him,<br>
No other obstacles: too certainly<br>
His life is death to us!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--Ah! do not heed<br>
My words: they spring from too much love.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Cly.</i>--And love<br>
Revealed to me their meaning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--Hast thou not<br>
Thy mind o'erwhelmed with horror?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Cly</i>.--Horror? ... yes; ...<br>
But then to part from thee! ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis</i>.--Wouldst have the courage? ...<br>
<br>
<i>Cly</i>.--So vast my love, it puts an end to fear.<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis</i>.--But the king lives surrounded by his friends:<br>
What sword would find a passage to his heart?<br>
<br>
<i>Cly</i>.--What sword?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis</i>.--Here open violence were vain.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aegis</i>.--'Tis true, he merits not<br>
To be betrayed, Atrides: he who loves<br>
His wife so well; he who, enchained from Troy,<br>
In semblance of a slave in fetters, brought<br>
Cassandra, whom he loves, to whom he is<br>
Himself a slave ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Cly</i>.--What do I hear!<br>

Expect that when of thee his love is wearied,<br>
He will divide with her his throne and bed;<br>
Expect that, to thy many other wrongs,<br>
Shame will be added: and do thou alone<br>
Not be exasperated at a deed<br>
That rouses every Argive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Cly</i>.--What said'st thou? ...<br>

Within that bed which he expects to share<br>
With this abhorred slave.<br>
<br>

<br>
I, e'en if thou wilt not. Shall I let thee,<br>
Who only dost deserve my love, be dragged<br>
To cruel death? And shall I let him live<br>
Who cares not for my love? I swear to thee,<br>
To-morrow thou shalt be the king in Argos.<br>
Nor shall my hand, nor shall my bosom tremble ...<br>
But who approaches?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--'Tis Electra ...<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Electra</i>--Aegisthus flies from me, and he does well;<br>
But I behold that likewise from my sight<br>
My mother seeks to fly. Infatuated<br>
And wretched mother! She could not resist<br>
The guilty eagerness for the last time<br>
To see Aegisthus.--They have here, at length,<br>
Conferred together ... But Aegisthus seems<br>
Too much elated, and too confident,<br>
For one condemned to exile ... She appeared<br>
Like one disturbed in thought, but more possessed<br>
With anger and resentment than with grief ...<br>
O Heavens! who knows to what that miscreant base,<br>
With his infernal arts, may have impelled her!<br>
To what extremities have wrought her up!...<br>
Now, now, indeed, I tremble: what misdeeds,<br>
How black in kind, how manifold in number,<br>
Do I behold! ... Yet, if I speak, I kill<br>
My mother: ... If I'm silent--? ...<br>

AEGISTHUS--CLYTEMNESTRA<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aegis.</i>--Hast thou performed the deed?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly</i>.--Aegisthus ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--What do I behold? O woman,<br>
What dost thou here, dissolved in useless tears?<br>
Tears are unprofitable, late, and vain;<br>
And they may cost us dear.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Cly.</i>--Thou here? ... but how? ...<br>
Wretch that I am! what have I promised thee?<br>
What impious counsel? ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis</i>.--Was not thine the counsel?<br>
Love gave it thee, and fear recants it.--Now,<br>
Since thou'rt repentant, I am satisfied;<br>
Soothed by reflecting that thou art not guilty,<br>
I shall at least expire. To thee I said<br>
How difficult the enterprise would be;<br>
But thou, depending more than it became thee<br>
On that which is not in thee, virile courage,<br>
Daredst thyself thy own unwarlike hand<br>
For such a blow select. May Heaven permit<br>
That the mere project of a deed like this<br>
May not be fatal to thee! I by stealth,<br>
Protected by the darkness, hither came,<br>
And unobserved, I hope. I was constrained<br>
To bring the news myself, that now my life<br>
Is irrecoverably forfeited<br>
To the king's vengeance...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Cly.</i>--What is this I hear?<br>
<br>
Whence didst thou learn it?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--More than he would wish<br>
<br>
Atrides hath discovered of our love;<br>
And I already from him have received<br>
A strict command not to depart from Argos.<br>
And further, I am summoned to his presence<br>
Soon as to-morrow dawns: thou seest well<br>
That such a conference to me is death.<br>
But fear not; for I will all means employ<br>
To bear myself the undivided blame.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly</i>.--What do I hear? Atrides knows it all?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis</i>.--He knows too much: I have but one choice left:<br>
<br>
It will be best for me to 'scape by death,<br>
By self-inflicted death, this dangerous inquest.<br>
I save my honor thus; and free myself<br>
From an opprobrious end. I hither came<br>
To give thee my last warning: and to take<br>
My last farewell... Oh, live; and may thy fame<br>
Live with thee, unimpeached! All thoughts of pity<br>
For me now lay aside; if I'm allowed<br>
By my own hand, for thy sake, to expire,<br>
I am supremely blest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly</i>.--Alas!... Aegisthus...<br>
<br>
What a tumultuous passion rages now<br>
Within my bosom, when I hear thee speak!...<br>
And is it true?... Thy death...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--Is more than certain....<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly</i>.--And I'm thy murderer!...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aegis</i>.--I seek thy safety.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly</i>.--What wicked fury from Avernus' shore,<br>
<br>
Aegisthus, guides thy steps? Oh, I had died<br>
Of grief, if I had never seen thee more;<br>
But guiltless I had died: spite of myself,<br>
Now, by thy presence, I already am<br>
Again impelled to this tremendous crime...<br>
An anguish, an unutterable anguish,<br>
Invades my bones, invades my every fibre...<br>
And can it be that this alone can save thee?...<br>
But who revealed our love?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aegis.</i>--To speak of thee,<br>
Who but Electra to her father dare?<br>
Who to the monarch breathe thy name but she?<br>
Thy impious daughter in thy bosom thrusts<br>
The fatal sword; and ere she takes thy life,<br>
Would rob thee of thy honor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Cly</i>.--And ought I<br>
<br>
This to believe?... Alas!...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aegis</i>.--Believe it, then,<br>
<br>
On the authority of this my sword,<br>
If thou believ'st it not on mine. At least<br>
I'll die in time...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly</i>.--O Heavens! what wouldst thou do?<br>
<br>
Sheathe, I command thee, sheathe that fatal sword.--Oh,<br>
night of horrors!... hear me... Perhaps Atrides<br>
Has not resolved...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis.</i>--What boots this hesitation?...<br>
<br>
Atrides injured, and Atrides king,<br>
Meditates nothing in his haughty mind<br>
But blood and vengeance. Certain is my death,<br>
Thine is uncertain: but reflect, O queen,<br>
To what thou'rt destined, if he spare thy life.<br>
And were I seen to enter here alone,<br>
And at so late an hour... Alas, what fears<br>
Harrow my bosom when I think of thee!<br>
Soon will the dawn of day deliver thee<br>
From racking doubt; that dawn I ne'er shall see:<br>
I am resolved to die:...--Farewell... forever!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cly</i>.--Stay, stay... Thou shalt not die.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Aegis</i>.--By no man's hand<br>
<br>
Assuredly, except my own:--or thine,<br>
If so thou wilt. Ah, perpetrate the deed;<br>
Kill me; and drag me, palpitating yet,<br>
Before thy judge austere: my blood will be<br>
A proud acquittance for thee.<br>

<i>Cly.</i>--Madd'ning thought!...<br>
Wretch that I am!... Shall I be thy assassin?...<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis.</i>--Shame on thy hand, that cannot either kill<br>
Who most adores thee, or who most detests thee!<br>
Mine then must serve....<br>
<br>
<i>Cly.</i>--Ah!... no....<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis.</i>--Dost thou desire<br>
Me, or Atrides, dead?<br>
<br>
<i>Cly.</i>--Ah! what a choice!...<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis.</i>--Thou art compelled to choose.<br>
<br>
<i>Cly.</i>--I death inflict ...<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis.</i>--Or death receive; when thou hast witnessed mine.<br>
<br>
<i>Cly.</i>--Ah, then the crime is too inevitable!<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis.</i>--The time now presses.<br>
<br>
<i>Cly.</i>--But ... the courage ... strength? ...<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis.</i>--Strength, courage, all, will love impart to thee.<br>
<br>
<i>Cly.</i>--Must I then with this trembling hand of mine<br>
Plunge ... in my husband's heart ... the sword? ...<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis</i>.--The blows<br>
Thou wilt redouble with a steady hand<br>
In the hard heart of him who slew thy daughter.<br>
<br>
<i>Cly.</i>--Far from my hand I hurled the sword in anguish.<br>
<br>
<i>Aegis</i>.--Behold a steel, and of another temper:<br>
The clotted blood-drops of Thyestes's sons<br>
Still stiffen on its frame: do not delay<br>
To furbish it once more in the vile blood<br>
Of Atreus; go, be quick: there now remain<br>
But a few moments; go. If awkwardly<br>
The blow thou aimest, or if thou shouldst be<br>
Again repentant, lady, ere 'tis struck,<br>
Do not thou any more tow'rd these apartments<br>
Thy footsteps turn: by my own hands destroyed,<br>
Here wouldst thou find me in a sea of blood<br>
Immersed. Now go, and tremble not; be bold.<br>
Enter and save us by his death.--<br>

Of blood is now prepared for thee, enjoy it;<br>

Already o'er the heart of thy foe's son<br>
Hangs the suspended sword; now, now, he feels it:<br>
An impious consort grasps it; it was fitting<br>
That she, not I, did this: so much more sweet<br>
To thee will be the vengeance, as the crime<br>
Is more atrocious.... An attentive ear<br>
Lend to the dire catastrophe with me;<br>
Doubt not she will accomplish it: disdain,<br>

<h2><a name="ALFONSO_THE_WISE"></a>ALFONSO THE WISE</h2>

<h3>(1221-1284)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-k.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ing Alfonso,&quot; records the Jesuit historian, Mariana, &quot;was a
man of great sense, but more fit to be a scholar than a
king; for whilst he studied the heavens and the stars, he
lost the earth and his kingdom.&quot; Certainly it is for his services to
letters, and not for political or military successes, that the meditative
son of the valorous Ferdinand the Saint and the beautiful Beatrice
of Swabia will be remembered. The father conquered Seville, and
displaced the enterprising and infidel Moors with orthodox and indolent
Christians. The son could not keep what his sire had grasped.
Born in 1226, the fortunate young prince, at the age of twenty-five,
was proclaimed king of the newly conquered and united Castile and
Leon. He was very young: he was everywhere admired and honored
for skill in war, for learning, and for piety; he was everywhere loved
for his heritage of a great name and his kindly and gracious manners.</p>

<p>In the first year of his reign, however, he began debasing the
coinage,--a favorite device of needy monarchs in his day,--and his
people never forgave the injury. He coveted, naturally enough, the
throne of the Empire, for which he was long a favorite candidate;
and for twenty years he wasted time, money, and purpose, heart and
hope, in pursuit of the vain bauble. His kingdom fell into confusion,
his eldest son died, his second son Sancho rebelled against him
and finally deposed him. Courageous and determined to the last,
defying the league of Church and State against him, he appealed to
the king of Morocco for men and money to reinstate his fortunes.</p>

<p>In Ticknor's 'History of Spanish Literature' may be found his
touching letter to De Guzman at the Moorish court. He is, like
Lear, poor and discrowned, but not like him, weak. His prelates have
stirred up strife, his nobles have betrayed him. If Heaven wills, he
is ready to pay generously for help. If not, says the royal philosopher,
still, generosity and loyalty exalt the soul that cherishes them.</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Therefore, my cousin, Alonzo Perez de Guzman, so treat with your
master and my friend [the king of Morocco] that he may lend me, on my
richest crown and on the jewels in it, as much as shall seem good to him:
and if you should be able to obtain his help for me, do not deprive me of it,
which I think you will not do; rather I hold that all the good offices which
my master may do me, by your hand they will come, and may the hand of
God be with you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Given in my only loyal city of Seville, the thirtieth year of my reign
and the first of my misfortunes.<br>
<br>
&quot;THE KING.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>In his &quot;only loyal city&quot; the broken man remained, until the Pope
excommunicated Sancho, and till neighboring towns began to capitulate.
But he had been wounded past healing. There was no medicine
for a mind diseased, no charm to raze out the written troubles
of the brain. &quot;He fell ill in Seville, so that he drew nigh unto
death.... And when the sickness had run its course, he said
before them all: that he pardoned the Infante Don Sancho, his heir,
all that out of malice he had done against him, and to his subjects
the wrong they had wrought towards him, ordering that letters confirming
the same should be written--sealed with his golden seal, so
that all his subjects should be certain that he had put away his
quarrel with them, and desired that no blame whatever should rest
upon them. And when he had said this, he received the body of
God with great devotion, and in a little while gave up his soul to
God.&quot;</p>

<p>This was in 1284, when he was fifty-eight years old. At this age,
had a private lot been his,--that of a statesman, jurist, man of science,
annalist, philosopher, troubadour, mathematician, historian,
poet,--he would but have entered his golden prime, rich in promise,
fruitful in performance. Yet Alfonso, uniting in himself all these
vocations, seemed at his death to have left behind him a wide waste
of opportunities, a dreary dearth of accomplishment. Looking back,
however, it is seen that the balance swings even. While his kingdom
was slipping away, he was conquering a wider domain. He was
creating Spanish Law, protecting the followers of learning, cherishing
the universities, restricting privilege, breaking up time-honored
abuses. He prohibited the use of Latin in public acts. He adopted
the native tongue in all his own works, and thus gave to Spanish an
honorable eminence, while French and German struggled long for a
learning from scholars, and English was to wait a hundred years for
the advent of Dan Chaucer.</p>

<p>Greatest achievement of all, he codified the common law of Spain
in 'Las Siete Partidas' (The Seven Parts). Still accepted as a legal
authority in the kingdom, the work is much more valuable as a compendium
of general knowledge than as an exposition of law. The
studious king with astonishing catholicity examined alike both Christian
and Arabic traditions, customs, and codes, paying a scholarly
respect to the greatness of a hostile language and literature. This
meditative monarch recognized that public office is a public trust,
and wrote:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Vicars of God are the kings, each one in his kingdom, placed over the
people to maintain them in justice and in truth. They have been called the
heart and soul of the people. For as the soul lies in the heart of men, and
by it the body lives and is maintained, so in the king lies justice, which is
the life and maintenance of the people of his lordship....<br><br>

&quot;And let the king guard the thoughts of his heart in three manners:
firstly let him not desire nor greatly care to have superfluous and worthless
honors. Superfluous and worthless honors the king <i>ought</i> not to desire. For
that which is beyond necessity cannot last, and being lost, and come short
of, turns to dishonor. Moreover, the wise men have said that it is no less a
virtue for a man to keep that which he has than to gain that which he has
not; because keeping comes of judgment, but gain of good fortune. And the
king who keeps his honor in such a manner that every day and by all means
it is increased, lacking nothing, and does not lose that which he has for that
which he desires to have,--he is held for a man of right judgment, who
loves his own people, and desires to lead them to all good. And God will
keep him in this world from the dishonoring of men, and in the next from
the dishonor of the wicked in hell.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides the 'Siete Partidas,' the royal philosopher was the author,
or compiler, of a 'Book of Hunting'; a treatise on Chess; a system
of law, the 'Fuero Castellano' (Spanish Code),--an attempt to
check the monstrous irregularities of municipal privilege; 'La Gran
Conquista d'Ultramar (The Great Conquest Beyond the Sea), an
account of the wars of the Crusades, which is the earliest known
specimen of Castilian prose; and several smaller works, now collected
under the general title of 'Opuscules Legales' (Minor Legal
Writings). It was long supposed that he wrote the 'Tesoro' (Thesaurus),
a curious medley of ignorance and superstition, much of it
silly, and all of it curiously inconsistent with the acknowledged character
of the enlightened King. Modern scholarship, however, discards
this petty treatise from the list of his productions.</p>

<p>His 'Tablas Alfonsinas' (Alfonsine Tables), to which Chaucer
refers in the 'Frankeleine's Tale,' though curiously mystical, yet were
really scientific, and rank among the most famous of mediaeval books.
Alfonso had the courage and the wisdom to recall to Toledo the
heirs and successors of the great Arabian philosophers and the
learned Rabbis, who had been banished by religious fanaticism, and
there to establish a permanent council--a mediaeval Academy of
Sciences--which devoted itself to the study of the heavens and the
making of astronomical calculations. &quot;This was the first time,&quot; says
the Spanish historian, &quot;that in barbarous times the Republic of
Letters was invited to contemplate a great school of learning,--men
occupied through many years in rectifying the old planetary observations,
in disputing about the most abstruse details of this science, in
constructing new instruments, and observing, by means of them, the
courses of the stars, their declensions, their ascensions, eclipses,
longitudes, and latitudes.&quot; It was the vision of Roger Bacon fulfilled.</p>

<p>At his own expense, for years together, the King entertained in
his palace at Burgos, that their knowledge might enrich the nation,
not only certain free-thinking followers of Averro&euml;s and Avicebron,
but infidel disciples of the Koran, and learned Rabbis who denied the
true faith. That creed must not interfere with deed, was an astonishing
mental attitude for the thirteenth century, and invited a general
suspicion of the King's orthodoxy. His religious sense was
really strong, however, and appears most impressively in the 'Cantigas
&agrave; la Vergen Maria' (Songs to the Virgin), which were sung
over his grave by priests and acolytes for hundreds of years. They
are sometimes melancholy and sometimes joyous, always simple and
genuine, and, written in Galician, reflect the trustful piety and happiness
of his youth in remote hill provinces where the thought of
empire had not penetrated. It was his keen intelligence that expressed
itself in the saying popularly attributed to him, &quot;Had I been
present at the creation, I might have offered some useful suggestions.&quot;
It was his reverent spirit that made mention in his will of
the sacred songs as the testimony to his faith. So lived and died
Alfonso the Tenth, the father of Spanish literature, and the reviver
of Spanish learning.</p>

<h3>&quot;<a name="WHAT_MEANETH_A_TYRANT"></a>WHAT MEANETH A TYRANT, AND HOW HE USETH HIS POWER
IN A KINGDOM WHEN HE HATH OBTAINED IT&quot;</h3>

<p>&quot;A tyrant,&quot; says this law, &quot;doth signify a cruel lord, who,
by force or by craft, or by treachery, hath obtained
power over any realm or country; and such men be of
such nature, that when once they have grown strong in the
land, they love rather to work their own profit, though it be in
harm of the land, than the common profit of all, for they always
live in an ill fear of losing it. And that they may be able to
fulfill this their purpose unincumbered, the wise of old have said
that they use their power against the people in three manners.
The first is, that they strive that those under their mastery be
ever ignorant and timorous, because, when they be such, they
may not be bold to rise against them, nor to resist their wills;
and the second is, that they be not kindly and united among
themselves, in such wise that they trust not one another, for
while they live in disagreement, they shall not dare to make any
discourse against their lord, for fear faith and secrecy should not
be kept among themselves; and the third way is, that they strive
to make them poor, and to put them upon great undertakings,
which they never can finish, whereby they may have so much
harm that it may never come into their hearts to devise anything
against their ruler. And above all this, have tyrants ever
striven to make spoil of the strong and to destroy the wise; and
have forbidden fellowship and assemblies of men in their land,
and striven always to know what men said or did; and do trust
their counsel and the guard of their person rather to foreigners,
who will serve at their will, than to them of the land, who
serve from oppression. And moreover, we say that though any
man may have gained mastery of a kingdom by any of the lawful
means whereof we have spoken in the laws going before this,
yet, if he use his power ill, in the ways whereof we speak in
this law, him may the people still call tyrant; for he turneth his
mastery which was rightful into wrongful, as Aristotle hath said
in the book which treateth of the rule and government of kingdoms.&quot;</p>

<p>From 'Las Siete Partidas,' quoted in Ticknor's 'Spanish Literature.'</p>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="ON_THE_TURKS"></a>ON THE TURKS, AND WHY THEY ARE SO CALLED</h3>

<p>The ancient histories which describe the early inhabitants of
the East and their various languages show the origin of
each tribe or nation, or whence they came, and for what
reason they waged war, and how they were enabled to conquer
the former lords of the land. Now in these histories it is told
that the Turks, and also the allied race called Turcomans, were
all of one land originally, and that these names were taken from
two rivers which flow through the territory whence these people
came, which lies in the direction of the rising of the sun, a little
toward the north; and that one of these rivers bore the name
of Turco, and the other Mani: and finally that for this reason
the two tribes which dwelt on the banks of these two rivers came
to be commonly known as Turcomanos or Turcomans. On the
other hand, there are those who assert that because a portion of
the Turks lived among the Comanos (Comans) they accordingly,
in course of time, received the name of Turcomanos; but the
majority adhere to the reason already given. However this may
be, the Turks and the Turcomans belong both to the same family,
and follow no other life than that of wandering over the
country, driving their herds from one good pasture to another,
and taking with them their wives and their children and all
their property, including money as well as flocks.</p>

<p>The Turks did not dwell then in houses, but in tents made of
skins, as do in these days the Comanos and Tartars; and when
they had to move from one place to another, they divided themselves
into companies according to their different dialects, and
chose a <i>cabdillo</i> (judge), who settled their disputes, and rendered
justice to those who deserved it. And this nomadic race cultivated
no fields, nor vineyards, nor orchards, nor arable lands of
any kind; neither did they buy or sell for money: but traded
their flocks among one another, and also their milk and cheese,
and pitched their tents in the places where they found the best
pasturage; and when the grass was exhausted, they sought fresh
herbage elsewhere. And whenever they reached the border of a
strange land, they sent before them special envoys, the most
worthy and honorable of their men, to the kings or lords of
such countries, to ask of them the privilege of pasturage on their
lands for a space; for which they were willing to pay such rent
or tax as might be agreed upon. After this manner they lived
among each nation in whose territory they happened to be.</p>

<h2><a name="ALFRED_THE_GREAT"></a>ALFRED THE GREAT</h2>

<h3>(849-901)</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-i.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>n the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford may be seen an antique
jewel, consisting of an enameled figure in red, blue, and
green, enshrined in a golden frame, and bearing the legend
&quot;Alfred mec heht gewyrcean&quot; (Alfred ordered me made). This
was discovered in 1693 in Newton Park, near Athelney, and through
it one is enabled to touch the far-away life of a thousand years ago.
But greater and more imperishable than this archaic gem is the gift
that the noble King left to the English nation--a gift that affects
the entire race of English-speaking people. For it was Alfred who
laid the foundations for a national literature.</p>

<p>Alfred, the younger son of Ethelwulf, king of the West Saxons,
and Osberga, daughter of his cup-bearer, was born in the palace at
Wantage in the year 849. He grew up at his father's court, a migratory
one, that moved from Kent to Devonshire and from Wales to
the Isle of Wight whenever events, raids, or the Witan (Parliament)
demanded. At an early age Alfred was sent to pay homage to the
Pope in Rome, taking such gifts as rich vessels of gold and silver,
silks, and hangings, which show that Saxons lacked nothing in
treasure. In 855 Ethelwulf visited Rome with his young son, bearing
more costly presents, as well as munificent sums for the shrine of
St. Peter's; and returning by way of France, they stopped at the
court of Charles the Bold. Once again in his home, young Alfred
applied himself to his education. He became a marvel of courage at
the chase, proficient in the use of arms, excelled in athletic sports,
was zealous in his religious duties, and athirst for knowledge. His
accomplishments were many; and when the guests assembled in the
great hall to make the walls ring with their laughter over cups of
mead and ale, he could take his turn with the harpers and minstrels
to improvise one of those sturdy bold ballads that stir the blood
to-day with their stately rhythms and noble themes.</p>

<p>Ethelwulf died in 858, and eight years later only two sons, Ethelred
and Alfred, were left to cope with the Danish invaders. They
won victory after victory, upon which the old chroniclers love to
dwell, pausing to describe wild frays among the chalk-hills and
dense forests, which afforded convenient places to hide men and to
bury spoils.</p>

<p>Ethelred died in 871, and the throne descended to Alfred. His
kingdom was in a terrible condition, for Wessex, Kent, Mercia, Sussex,
and Surrey lay at the mercy of the marauding enemy. &quot;The
land,&quot; says an old writer, &quot;was as the Garden of Eden before them,
and behind them a desolate wilderness.&quot; London was in ruins; the
Danish standard, with its black Raven, fluttered everywhere; and the
forests were filled with outposts and spies of the &quot;pagan army.&quot;
There was nothing for the King to do but gather his men and dash
into the fray to &quot;let the hard steel ring upon the high helmet.&quot;
Time after time the Danes are overthrown, but, like the heads of the
fabled Hydra, they grow and flourish after each attack. They have
one advantage: they know how to command the sea, and numerous
as the waves that their vessels ride so proudly and well, the invaders
arrive and quickly land to plunder and slay.</p>

<p>Alfred, although but twenty-five, sees the need for a navy, and in
875 gathers a small fleet to meet the ships of the enemy, wins one
prize, and puts the rest to flight. The chroniclers now relate that he
fell into disaster and became a fugitive in Selwood Forest, while
Guthrum and his host were left free to ravage. From this period
date the legends of the King's visit in disguise to the hut of the
neat-herd, and his burning the bread he was set to watch; his penetrating
into the camp of the Danes and entertaining Guthrum by his
minstrelsy while discovering his plans and force; the vision of St.
Cuthbert; and the fable of his calling five hundred men by the
winding of his horn.</p>

<p>Not long after he was enabled to emerge from the trials of exile
in Athelney; and according to Asser, &quot;In the seventh week after
Easter, he rode to Egbert's Stone in the eastern part of Selwood or
the Great Wood, called in the old British language Coit-mawr.
Here he was met by all the neighboring folk of Somersetshire, Wiltshire,
and Hampshire, who had not for fear of the Pagans fled
beyond the sea; and when they saw the king alive after such great
tribulation, they received him, as he deserved, with joy and acclamations
and all encamped there for the night.&quot; Soon afterward
he made a treaty with the Danes, and became king of the whole of
England south of the Thames.</p>

<p>It was now Alfred's work to reorganize his kingdom, to strengthen
the coast defenses, to rebuild London, to arrange for a standing
army, and to make wise laws for the preservation of order and
peace; and when all this was accomplished, he turned his attention
to the establishment of monasteries and colleges. &quot;In the mean-time,&quot;
says old Asser, &quot;the King, during the frequent wars and
other trammels of this present life, the invasions of the Pagans, and
his own daily infirmities of body, continued to carry on the government,
and to exercise hunting in all its branches; to teach his
workers in gold and artificers of all kinds, his falconers, hawkers,
and dog-keepers, to build houses majestic and good, beyond all the
precedents of his ancestors, by his new mechanical inventions, to
recite the Saxon books, and more especially to learn by heart the
Saxon poems, and to make others learn them also; for he alone
never desisted from studying, most diligently, to the best of his
ability; he attended the mass and other daily services of religion:
he was frequent in psalm-singing and prayer, at the proper hours,
both of the night and of the day. He also went to the churches, as
we have already said, in the night-time, to pray, secretly and unknown
to his courtiers; he bestowed alms and largesses both on his
own people and on foreigners of all countries; he was affable and
pleasant to all, and curious to investigate things unknown.&quot;</p>

<p>As regards Alfred's personal contribution to literature, it may be
said that over and above all disputed matters and certain lost works,
they represent a most valuable and voluminous assortment due
directly to his own royal and scholarly pen. History, secular and
churchly, laws and didactic literature, were his field; and though it
would seem that his actual period of composition did not much exceed
ten years, yet he accomplished a vast deal for any man, especially any
busy sovereign and soldier.</p>

<p>An ancient writer, Ethelwerd, says that he translated many books
from Latin into Saxon, and William of Malmesbury goes so far as to
say that he translated into Anglo-Saxon almost all the literature of
Rome. Undoubtedly the general condition of education was deplorable,
and Alfred felt this deeply. &quot;Formerly,&quot; he writes, &quot;men
came hither from foreign lands to seek instruction, and now when
we desire it, we can only obtain it from abroad.&quot; Like Charlemagne
he drew to his court famous scholars, and set many of them to work
writing chronicles and translating important Latin books into Anglo-Saxon.
Among these was the 'Pastoral Care of Pope Gregory,' to
which he wrote the Preface; but with his own hand he translated
the 'Consolations of Philosophy,' by Boethius, two manuscripts of
which still exist. In this he frequently stops to introduce observations
and comments of his own. Of greater value was his translation of
the 'History of the World,' by Orosius, which he abridged, and to
which he added new chapters giving the record of coasting voyages
in the north of Europe. This is preserved in the Cotton MSS. in the
British Museum. His fourth translation was the 'Ecclesiastical History
of the English Nation,' by Bede. To this last may be added
the 'Blossom Gatherings from St. Augustine,' and many minor compositions
in prose and verse, translations from the Latin fables and
poems, and his own note-book, in which he jots, with what may be
termed a journalistic instinct, scenes that he had witnessed, such as
Aldhelm standing on the bridge instructing the people on Sunday
afternoons; bits of philosophy; and such reflections as the following,
which remind one of Marcus Aurelius:--&quot;Desirest thou power? But
thou shalt never obtain it without sorrows--sorrows from strange
folk, and yet keener sorrows from thine own kindred.&quot; and &quot;Hardship
and sorrow! Not a king but would wish to be without these if
he could. But I know that he cannot.&quot; Alfred's value to literature
is this: he placed by the side of Anglo-Saxon poetry,--consisting of
two great poems, Caedmon's great song of the 'Creation' and Cynewulf's
'Nativity and Life of Christ,' and the unwritten ballads passed
from lip to lip,--four immense translations from Latin into Anglo-Saxon
prose, which raised English from a mere spoken dialect to a
true language. From his reign date also the famous Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle and the Anglo-Saxon Gospels; and a few scholars are
tempted to class the magnificent 'Beowulf' among the works of this
period. At any rate, the great literary movement that he inaugurated
lasted until the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>In 893 the Danes once more disturbed King Alfred, but he foiled
them at all points, and they left in 897 to harry England no more
for several generations. In 901 he died, having reigned for thirty
years in the honor and affection of his subjects. Freeman in his
'Norman Conquest' says that &quot;no other man on record has ever so
thoroughly united all the virtues both of the ruler and of the private
man.&quot; Bishop Asser, his contemporary, has left a half-mythical
eulogy, and William of Malmesbury, Roger of Wendover, Matthew
of Westminster, and John Brompton talk of him fully and freely.
Sir John Spellman published a quaint biography in Oxford in 1678,
followed by Powell's in 1634, and Bicknell's in 1777. The modern
lives are by Giles, Pauli, and Hughes.</p>

<h3><a name="KING_ALFRED_ON_KING-CRAFT"></a>KING ALFRED ON KING-CRAFT</h3>

<center>Comment in his Translation of Boethius's 'Consolations of Philosophy'</center>

<p>The mind then answered and thus said: O Reason, indeed
thou knowest that covetousness and the greatness of this
earthly power never well pleased me, nor did I altogether
very much yearn after this earthly authority. But nevertheless I
was desirous of materials for the work which I was commanded
to perform; that was, that I might honorably and fitly guide and
exercise the power which was committed to me. Moreover, thou
knowest that no man can show any skill nor exercise or control
any power, without tools and materials. There are of every
craft the materials without which man cannot exercise the craft.
These, then, are a king's materials and his tools to reign with:
that he have his land well peopled; he must have prayer-men,
and soldiers, and workmen. Thou knowest that without these
tools no king can show his craft. This is also his materials
which he must have besides the tools: provisions for the three
classes. This is, then, their provision: land to inhabit, and gifts
and weapons, and meat, and ale, and clothes, and whatsoever is
necessary for the three classes. He cannot without these preserve
the tools, nor without the tools accomplish any of those
things which he is commanded to perform. Therefore, I was
desirous of materials wherewith to exercise the power, that my
talents and power should not be forgotten and concealed. For
every craft and every power soon becomes old, and is passed
over in silence, if it be without wisdom: for no man can accomplish
any craft without wisdom. Because whatsoever is done
through folly, no one can ever reckon for craft. This is now
especially to be said: that I wished to live honorably whilst I
lived, and after my life, to leave to the men who were after me,
my memory in good works.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="ALFRED'S_PREFACE"></a>ALFRED'S PREFACE TO THE VERSION OF POPE GREGORY'S 'PASTORAL CARE'</h3>

<p>King Alfred bids greet Bishop Waerferth with his words lovingly
and with friendship; and I let it be known to thee
that it has very often come into my mind, what wise men
there formerly were throughout England, both of sacred and secular
orders; and what happy times there were then throughout
England; and how the kings who had power of the nation in
those days obeyed God and his ministers; and they preserved
peace, morality, and order at home, and at the same time enlarged
their territory abroad; and how they prospered both with
war and with wisdom; and also the sacred orders, how zealous
they were, both in teaching and learning, and in all the services
they owed to God; and how foreigners came to this land in
search of wisdom and instruction, and how we should now have
to get them from abroad if we would have them. So general
was its decay in England that there were very few on this side
of the Humber who could understand their rituals in English,
or translate a letter from Latin into English; and I believe
there were not many beyond the Humber. There were so few
that I cannot remember a single one south of the Thames when
I came to the throne. Thanks be to God Almighty that we
have any teachers among us now. And therefore I command
thee to do as I believe thou art willing, to disengage thyself
from worldly matters as often as thou canst, that thou mayst
apply the wisdom which God has given thee wherever thou
canst. Consider what punishments would come upon us on
account of this world if we neither loved it (wisdom) ourselves
nor suffered other men to obtain it: we should love the name
only of Christian, and very few of the virtues.</p>

<p>When I considered all this I remembered also how I saw,
before it had been all ravaged and burnt, how the churches
throughout the whole of England stood filled with treasures and
books, and there was also a great multitude of God's servants;
but they had very little knowledge of the books, for they could
not understand anything of them, because they were not written
in their own language. As if they had said, &quot;Our forefathers,
who formerly held these places, loved wisdom, and through it
they obtained wealth and bequeathed it to us. In this we can
still see their tracks, but we cannot follow them, and therefore
we have lost both the wealth and the wisdom, because we would
not incline our hearts after their example.&quot;</p>

<p>When I remembered all this, I wondered extremely that the
good and wise men, who were formerly all over England, and
had perfectly learnt all the books, did not wish to translate
them into their own language. But again, I soon answered
myself and said, &quot;They did not think that men would ever be
so careless, and that learning would so decay; therefore they
abstained from translating, and they trusted that the wisdom in
this land might increase with our knowledge of languages.&quot;</p>

<p>Then I remember how the law was first known in Hebrew,
and again, when the Greeks had learnt it, they translated the
whole of it into their own language, and all other books besides.
And again, the Romans, when they had learnt it, they translated
the whole of it through learned interpreters into their own
language. And also all other Christian nations translated a part
of them into their own language. Therefore it seems better to
me, if ye think so, for us also to translate some books which are
most needful for all men to know, into the language which we
can all understand, and for you to do as we very easily can if we
have tranquillity enough; that is, that all the youth now in
England of free men, who are rich enough to be able to devote
themselves to it, be set to learn as long as they are not fit for
any other occupation, until that they are well able to read English
writing: and let those be afterward taught more in the Latin
language who are to continue learning and be promoted to a
higher rank. When I remember how the knowledge of Latin had
formerly decayed throughout England, and yet many could read
English writing, I began among other various and manifold
troubles of this kingdom, to translate into English the book which
is called in Latin 'Pastoralis,' and in English 'Shepherd's Book,'
sometimes word by word and sometimes according to the sense,
as I had learnt it from Plegmund, my archbishop, and Asser, my
bishop, and Grimbold, my mass-priest, and John, my mass-priest.
And when I had learnt it as I could best understand it, and as I
could most clearly interpret it, I translated it into English; and
I will send a copy to every bishopric in my kingdom; and on
each there is a clasp worth fifty mancus. And I command, in
God's name, that no man take the clasp from the book or the
book from the minister: it is uncertain how long there may be
such learned bishops as now, thanks be to God, there are nearly
everywhere; therefore, I wish them always to remain in their
place, unless the bishop wish to take them with him, or they be
lent out anywhere, or any one make a copy from them.</p>

<p>In every tree I saw something there which I needed at home,
therefore I advise every one who is able and has many
wains, that he trade to the same wood where I cut the stud
shafts, and there fetch more for himself and load his wain with
fair rods, that he may wind many a neat wall and set many a
comely house and build many a fair town of them; and thereby
may dwell merrily and softly, so as I now yet have not done.
But He who taught me, to whom the wood was agreeable, He may
make me to dwell more softly in this temporary cottage, the while
that I am in this world, and also in the everlasting home which
He has promised us through St. Augustine, and St. Gregory, and
St. Jerome, and through other holy fathers; as I believe also
that for the merits of all these He will make the way more convenient
than it was before, and especially the carrying and the
building: but every man wishes after he has built a cottage on
his lord's lease by his help, that he may sometimes rest him
therein and hunt, and fowl, and fish, and use it every way under
the lease both on water and on land, until the time that he earn
book-land and everlasting heritage through his lord's mercy. So
do enlighten the eyes of my mind so that I may search out the
right way to the everlasting home and the everlasting glory, and
the everlasting rest which is promised us through those holy
fathers. May it be so! ...</p>

<p>It is no wonder though men swink in timber working, and in
the wealthy Giver who wields both these temporary cottages and
eternal homes. May He who shaped both and wields both, grant
me that I may be meet for each, both here to be profitable and
thither to come.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARLES_GRANT_ALLEN"></a>CHARLES GRANT ALLEN</h2>

<h3>(1848-)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he Irish-Canadian naturalist, Charles Grant Blairfindie Allen,
who turns his industrious hand with equal facility to scientific
writing, to essays, short stories, botanical treatises,
biography, and novels, is known to literature as Grant Allen, as
&quot;Arbuthnot Wilson,&quot; and as &quot;Cecil Power.&quot;</p>

<p>His work may be divided into two classes: fiction and popular
essays. The first shows the author to be familiar with varied scenes
and types, and exhibits much feeling for dramatic situations. His
list of novels is long, and includes among others, 'Strange Stories,'
'Babylon,' 'This Mortal Coil,' 'The Tents of Shem,' 'The Great
Taboo,' 'Recalled to Life,' 'The Woman Who Did,' and 'The British
Barbarians.' In many of these books he has woven his plots around
a psychological theme; a proof that science interests him more than
invention. His essays are written for unscientific readers, and carefully
avoid all technicalities and tedious discussions. Most persons,
he says, &quot;would much rather learn why birds have feathers than
why they have a keeled sternum, and they think the origin of bright
flowers far more attractive than the origin of monocotyledonous
seeds or esogenous stems.&quot;</p>

<p>Grant Allen was born in Kingston, Canada, February 24th, 1848.
After graduation at Merton College, Oxford, he occupied for four
years the chair of logic and philosophy at Queen's College, Spanish
Town, Jamaica, which he resigned to settle in England, where he
now resides. Early in his career he became an enthusiastic follower
of Darwin and Herbert Spencer, and published the attractive books
entitled 'Science in Arcady,' 'Vignettes from Nature,' 'The Evolutionist
at Large,' and 'Colin Clout's Calendar.' In his preface to
'Vignettes from Nature,' he says that the &quot;essays are written from
an easy-going, half-scientific half-aesthetic standpoint.&quot; In this spirit
he rambles in the woods, in the meadows, at the seaside, or upon
the heather-carpeted moor, finding in such expeditions material and
suggestions for his lightly moving essays, which expound the problems
of Nature according to the theories of his acknowledged masters.
A fallow deer grazing in a forest, a wayside berry, a guelder
rose, a sportive butterfly, a bed of nettles, a falling leaf, a mountain
tarn, the hole of a hedgehog, a darting humming-bird, a ripening
plum, a clover-blossom, a spray of sweet-briar, a handful of wild
thyme, or a blaze of scarlet geranium before a cottage door, furnish
him with a text for the discussion of &quot;those biological and cosmical
doctrines which have revolutionized the thought of the nineteenth
century,&quot; as he says in substance.</p>

<p>Somewhat more scientific are 'Psychological Aesthetics,' 'The
Color Sense,' 'The Color of Flowers,' and 'Flowers and their Pedigrees';
and still deeper is 'Force and Energy' (1888), a theory of
dynamics in which he expresses original views. In 'Psychological
Aesthetics' (1877), he first seeks to explain &quot;such simple pleasures in
bright color, sweet sound, or rude pictorial imitation as delight the
child and the savage, proceeding from these elementary principles
to the more and more complex gratifications of natural scenery,
painting, and poetry.&quot; In 'The Color Sense' he defines all that we
do not owe to the color sense, for example the rainbow, the sunset,
the sky, the green or purple sea, the rocks, the foliage of trees and
shrubs, hues of autumn, effects of iridescent light, or tints of minerals
and precious stones; and all that we do owe, namely, &quot;the
beautiful flowers of the meadow and the garden-roses, lilies, cowslips,
and daisies; the exquisite pink of the apple, the peach, the
mango, and the cherry, with all the diverse artistic wealth of
oranges, strawberries, plums, melons, brambleberries, and pomegranates;
the yellow, blue, and melting green of tropical butterflies; the
magnificent plumage of the toucan, the macaw, the cardinal-bird,
the lory, and the honey-sucker; the red breast of our homely robin;
the silver or ruddy fur of the ermine, the wolverene, the fox, the
squirrel, and the chinchilla; the rosy cheeks and pink lips of the
English maiden; the whole catalogue of dyes, paints, and pigments;
and last of all, the colors of art in every age and nation, from the
red cloth of the South Seas, the lively frescoes of the Egyptian and
the subdued tones of Hellenic painters, to the stained windows of
Poictiers and the Madonna of the Sistine Chapel.&quot; Besides these
books, Mr. Allen has written for the series called 'English Worthies'
a sympathetic 'Life of Charles Darwin' (1885).</p>

<h3><a name="THE_COLORATION_OF_FLOWERS"></a>THE COLORATION OF FLOWERS</h3>

<center>From 'The Colors of Flowers'</center>

<p>The different hues assumed by petals are all thus, as it were,
laid up beforehand in the tissues of the plant, ready to be
brought out at a moment's notice. And all flowers, as we
know, easily sport a little in color. But the question is, Do their
changes tend to follow any regular and definite order? Is there
any reason to believe that the modification runs from any one
color toward any other? Apparently there is. The general conclusion
to be set forth in this work is the statement of such a
tendency. All flowers, it would seem, were in their earliest form
yellow; then some of them became white; after that, a few of
them grew to be red or purple; and finally, a comparatively
small number acquired various shades of lilac, mauve, violet, or
blue. So that if this principle be true, such a flower as the harebell
will represent one of the most highly developed lines of
descent; and its ancestors will have passed successively through
all the intermediate stages. Let us see what grounds can be
given for such a belief.</p>

<p>Some hints of a progressive law in the direction of a color-change
from yellow to blue are sometimes afforded to us even by
the successive stages of a single flower. For example, one of our
common little English forget-me-nots, <i>Myosotis versicolor</i>, is pale
yellow when it first opens; but as it grows older, it becomes
faintly pinkish, and ends by being blue, like the others of its
race. Now, this sort of color-change is by no means uncommon;
and in almost all known cases it is always in the same direction,
from yellow or white, through pink, orange, or red, to purple or
blue. For example, one of the wall-flowers, <i>Cheiranthus chamoeleo</i>,
has at first a whitish flower, then a citron-yellow, and finally
emerges into red or violet. The petals of <i>Stytidium fructicosum</i>
are pale yellow to begin with, and afterward become light rose-colored.
An evening primrose, <i>Oenothera tetraptera</i>, has white
flowers in its first stage, and red ones at a later period of development.
<i>Cobea scandens</i> goes from white to violet; <i>Hibiscus
mutabilis</i> from white through flesh-colored to red. The common
Virginia stock of our gardens <i>(Malcolmia)</i> often opens of a pale
yellowish green, then becomes faintly pink; afterward deepens
into bright red; and fades away at the last into mauve or blue.
Fritz M&uuml;ller's <i>Lantana</i> is yellow on its first day, orange on its
second, and purple on the third. The whole family of <i>Boraginaceae</i>
begin by being pink and end with being blue. The garden convolvulus
opens a blushing white and passes into full purple. In
all these and many other cases the general direction of the
changes is the same. They are usually set down as due to varying
degrees of oxidation in the pigmentary matter. If this be so,
there is a good reason why bees should be specially fond of blue,
and why blue flowers should be specially adapted for fertilization
by their aid. For Mr. A.R. Wallace has shown that color is
most apt to appear or to vary in those parts of plants or animals
which have undergone the highest amount of modification. The
markings of the peacock and the argus pheasant come out upon
their immensely developed secondary tail-feathers or wing-plumes;
the metallic hues of sun-birds, or humming-birds, show themselves
upon their highly specialized crests, gorgets, or lappets. It
is the same with the hackles of fowls, the head ornaments of
fruit-pigeons, and the bills of toucans. The most exquisite colors
in the insect world are those which are developed on the greatly
expanded and delicately feathered wings of butterflies; and the
eye-spots which adorn a few species are usually found on their
very highly modified swallow-tail appendages. So too with flowers:
those which have undergone most modification have their
colors most profoundly altered. In this way, we may put it down
as a general rule (to be tested hereafter) that the least developed
flowers are usually yellow or white; those which have undergone
a little more modification are usually pink or red; and those which
have been most highly specialized of any are usually purple, lilac,
or blue. Absolute deep ultramarine probably marks the highest
level of all.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Wallace's principle also explains why
the bees and butterflies should prefer these specialized colors to
all others, and should therefore select those flowers which display
them by preference over any less developed types; for bees and
butterflies are the most highly adapted of all insects to honey-seeking
and flower-feeding. They have themselves on their side
undergone the largest amount of specialization for that particular
function. And if the more specialized and modified flowers,
which gradually fitted their forms and the position of their honey-glands
to the forms of the bees or butterflies, showed a natural
tendency to pass from yellow through pink and red to purple
and blue, it would follow that the insects which were being
evolved side by side with them, and which were aiding at the
same time in their evolution, would grow to recognize these
developed colors as the visible symbols of those flowers from
which they could obtain the largest amount of honey with the
least possible trouble. Thus it would finally result that the
ordinary unspecialized flowers, which depended upon small insect
riff-raff, would be mostly left yellow or white; those which
appealed to rather higher insects would become pink or red; and
those which laid themselves out for bees or butterflies, the aristocrats
of the arthropodous world, would grow for the most part
to be purple or blue.</p>

<p>Now, this is very much what we actually find to be the
case in nature. The simplest and earliest flowers are those with
regular, symmetrical open cups, like the <i>Ranunculus</i> genus, the
<i>Potentillas</i>, and the <i>Alsine</i> or chickweeds, which can be visited
by any insects whatsoever; and these are in large part yellow or
white. A little higher are flowers like the Campions or <i>Sileneoe</i>,
and the stocks (<i>Matthiola</i>), with more or less closed cups, whose
honey can only be reached by more specialized insects; and these
are oftener pink or reddish. More profoundly modified are those
irregular one-sided flowers, like the violets, peas, and orchids,
which have assumed special shapes to accommodate bees and
other specific honey-seekers; and these are often purple and not
unfrequently blue. Highly specialized in another way are the
flowers like harebells (<i>Campanulaceoe</i>), scabious (<i>Dipsaceoe</i>), and
heaths (<i>Ericaceoe</i>), whose petals have all coalesced into a tubular
corolla; and these might almost be said to be usually purple or
blue. And finally, highest of all are the flowers like labiates
(rosemary, <i>Salvia</i>, etc.) and speedwells (<i>Veronica</i>), whose tubular
corolla has been turned to one side, thus combining the united
petals with the irregular shape; and these are almost invariably
purple or blue.</p>

<h3><a name="AMONG_THE_HEATHER"></a>AMONG THE HEATHER</h3>

<center>From 'The Evolutionist at Large'</center>
<br>

<p>I suppose even that apocryphal person, the general reader, would
be insulted at being told at this hour of the day that all
bright-colored flowers are fertilized by the visits of insects,
whose attentions they are specially designed to solicit. Everybody
has heard over and over again that roses, orchids, and
columbines have acquired their honey to allure the friendly bee,
their gaudy petals to advertise the honey, and their divers shapes
to insure the proper fertilization by the correct type of insect.
But everybody does not know how specifically certain blossoms
have laid themselves out for a particular species of fly, beetle,
or tiny moth. Here on the higher downs, for instance, most flowers
are exceptionally large and brilliant; while all Alpine climbers
must have noticed that the most gorgeous masses of bloom
in Switzerland occur just below the snow-line. The reason is,
that such blossoms must be fertilized by butterflies alone. Bees,
their great rivals in honey-sucking, frequent only the lower meadows
and slopes, where flowers are many and small: they seldom
venture far from the hive or the nest among the high peaks and
chilly nooks where we find those great patches of blue gentian
or purple anemone, which hang like monstrous breadths of tapestry
upon the mountain sides. This heather here, now fully opening
in the warmer sun of the southern counties--it is still but
in the bud among the Scotch hills, I doubt not--specially lays
itself out for the humble-bee, and its masses form almost his
highest pasture-grounds; but the butterflies--insect vagrants that
they are--have no fixed home, and they therefore stray far
above the level at which bee-blossoms altogether cease to grow.
Now, the butterfly differs greatly from the bee in his mode of
honey-hunting: he does not bustle about in a business-like manner
from one buttercup or dead-nettle to its nearest fellow; but
he flits joyously, like a sauntering straggler that he is, from a
great patch of color here to another great patch at a distance,
whose gleam happens to strike his roving eye by its size and
brilliancy. Hence, as that indefatigable observer, Dr. Hermann
M&uuml;ller, has noticed, all Alpine or hill-top flowers have very large
and conspicuous blossoms, generally grouped together in big clusters
so as to catch a passing glance of the butterfly's eye.
As soon as the insect spies such a cluster, the color seems to act
as a stimulant to his broad wings, just as the candle-light does to
those of his cousin the moth. Off he sails at once, as if by automatic
action, towards the distant patch, and there both robs the
plant of its honey, and at the same time carries to it on his legs
and head fertilizing pollen from the last of its congeners which
he favored with a call. For of course both bees and butterflies
stick on the whole to a single species at a time; or else the
flowers would only get uselessly hybridized, instead of being
impregnated with pollen from other plants of their own kind.
For this purpose it is that most plants lay themselves out to
secure the attention of only two or three varieties among their
insect allies, while they make their nectaries either too deep or
too shallow for the convenience of all other kinds.</p>

<p>Insects, however, differ much from one another in their aesthetic
tastes, and flowers are adapted accordingly to the varying
fancies of the different kinds. Here, for example, is a spray of
common white galium, which attracts and is fertilized by small
flies, who generally frequent white blossoms. But here again,
not far off, I find a luxuriant mass of the yellow species, known
by the quaint name of &quot;lady's-bedstraw,&quot;--a legacy from the old
legend which represents it as having formed Our Lady's bed in
the manger at Bethlehem. Now why has this kind of galium
yellow flowers, while its near kinsman yonder has them snowy
white? The reason is that lady's-bedstraw is fertilized by small
beetles; and beetles are known to be one among the most color-loving
races of insects. You may often find one of their number,
the lovely bronze and golden-mailed rose-chafer, buried deeply in
the very centre of a red garden rose, and reeling about when
touched as if drunk with pollen and honey. Almost all the
flowers which beetles frequent are consequently brightly decked
in scarlet or yellow. On the other hand, the whole family of the
umbellates, those tall plants with level bunches of tiny blossoms,
like the fool's-parsley, have all but universally white petals; and
M&uuml;ller, the most statistical of naturalists, took the trouble to
count the number of insects which paid them a visit. He found
that only fourteen per cent. were bees, while the remainder consisted
mainly of miscellaneous small flies and other arthropodous
riff-raff, whereas, in the brilliant class of composites, including
the asters, sunflowers, daisies, dandelions, and thistles, nearly
seventy-five per cent. of the visitors were steady, industrious bees.
Certain dingy blossoms which lay themselves out to attract wasps,
are obviously adapted, as M&uuml;ller quaintly remarks, &quot;to a less aesthetically
cultivated circle of visitors.&quot; But the most brilliant
among all insect-fertilized flowers are those which specially affect
the society of butterflies; and they are only surpassed in this
respect throughout all nature by the still larger and more magnificent
tropical species which owe their fertilization to humming-birds
and brush-tongued lories.</p>

<p>Is it not a curious, yet a comprehensible circumstance, that
the tastes which thus show themselves in the development, by
natural selection, of lovely flowers, should also show themselves
in the marked preference for beautiful mates? Poised on yonder
sprig of harebell stands a little purple-winged butterfly, one of
the most exquisite among our British kinds. That little butterfly
owes its own rich and delicately shaded tints to the long selective
action of a million generations among its ancestors. So we find
throughout that the most beautifully colored birds and insects are
always those which have had most to do with the production of
bright-colored fruits and flowers. The butterflies and rose-beetles
are the most gorgeous among insects; the humming-birds and parrots
are the most gorgeous among birds. Nay, more, exactly like
effects have been produced in two hemispheres on different tribes
by the same causes. The plain brown swifts of the North have
developed among tropical West Indian and South American
orchids the metallic gorgets and crimson crests of the humming-bird;
while a totally unlike group of Asiatic birds have developed
among the rich flora of India and the Malay Archipelago the
exactly similar plumage of the exquisite sun-birds. Just as bees
depend upon flowers, and flowers upon bees, so the color-sense of
animals has created the bright petals of blossoms; and the bright
petals have reacted upon the tastes of the animals themselves,
and through their tastes upon their own appearance.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HERON'S_HAUNT"></a>THE HERON'S HAUNT</h3>

<center>From 'Vignettes from Nature'</center>

<p>Most of the fields on the country-side are now laid up for
hay, or down in the tall haulming corn; and so I am
driven from my accustomed botanizing grounds on the
open, and compelled to take refuge in the wild bosky moor-land
back of Hole Common. Here, on the edge of the copse,
the river widens to a considerable pool, and coming upon it
softly through the wood from behind--the boggy, moss-covered
ground masking and muffling my foot-fall--I have surprised a
great, graceful ash-and-white heron, standing all unconscious on
the shallow bottom, in the very act of angling for minnows.
The heron is a somewhat rare bird among the more cultivated
parts of England; but just hereabouts we get a sight of one
not infrequently, for they still breed in a few tall ash-trees at
Chilcombe Park, where the lords of the manor in mediaeval
times long preserved a regular heronry to provide sport for
their hawking. There is no English bird, not even the swan,
so perfectly and absolutely graceful as the heron. I am leaning
now breathless and noiseless against the gate, taking a good
look at him, as he stands half-knee deep on the oozy bottom,
with his long neck arched over the water, and his keen purple
eye fixed eagerly upon the fish below. Though I am still
twenty yards from where he poises lightly on his stilted legs, I
can see distinctly his long pendent snow-white breast-feathers,
his crest of waving black plumes, falling loosely backward over
the ash-gray neck, and even the bright red skin of his bare
legs just below the feathered thighs. I dare hardly move
nearer to get a closer view of his beautiful plumage; and
still I will try. I push very quietly through the gate, but not
quite quietly enough for the heron. One moment he raises his
curved neck and poises his head a little on one side to listen
for the direction of the rustling; then he catches a glimpse of
me as I try to draw back silently behind a clump of flags and
nettles; and in a moment his long legs give him a good spring
from the bottom, his big wings spread with a sudden flap sky-wards,
and almost before I can note what is happening he is
off and away to leeward, making a bee-line for the high trees
that fringe the artificial water in Chilcombe Hollow.</p>

<p>All these wading birds the herons, the cranes, the bitterns,
the snipes, and the plovers are almost necessarily, by the very
nature of their typical conformation, beautiful and graceful in
form. Their tall, slender legs, which they require for wading,
their comparatively light and well-poised bodies, their long,
curved, quickly-darting necks and sharp beaks, which they need
in order to secure their rapid-swimming prey, all these things
make the waders, almost in spite of themselves, handsome and
shapely birds. Their feet, it is true, are generally rather large
and sprawling, with long, wide-spread toes, so as to distribute
their weight on the snow-shoe principle, and prevent them from
sinking in the deep soft mud on which they tread; but then we
seldom see the feet, because the birds, when we catch a close
view of them at all, are almost always either on stilts in the
water, or flying with their legs tucked behind them, after their
pretty rudder-like fashion. I have often wondered whether it
is this general beauty of form in the waders which has turned
their aesthetic tastes, apparently, into such a sculpturesque line.
Certainly, it is very noteworthy that whenever among this
particular order of birds we get clear evidence of ornamental
devices, such as Mr. Darwin sets down to long-exerted selective
preferences in the choice of mates, the ornaments are almost
always those of form rather than those of color.</p>

<p>The waders, I sometimes fancy, only care for beauty of
shape, not for beauty of tint. As I stood looking at the heron
here just now, the same old idea seemed to force itself more
clearly than ever upon my mind. The decorative adjuncts--the
curving tufted crest on the head, the pendent silvery gorget on
the neck, the long ornamental quills of the pinions--all look
exactly as if they were deliberately intended to emphasize and
heighten the natural gracefulness of the heron's form. May it
not be, I ask myself, that these birds, seeing one another's
statuesque shape from generation to generation, have that shape
hereditarily implanted upon the nervous system of the species,
in connection with all their ideas of mating and of love, just
as the human form is hereditarily associated with all our deepest
emotions, so that Miranda falling in love at first sight with
Ferdinand is not a mere poetical fiction, but the true illustration
of a psychological fact? And as on each of our minds and
brains the picture of the beautiful human figure is, as it were,
antecedently engraved, may not the ancestral type be similarly
engraved on the minds and brains of the wading birds? If so,
would it not be natural to conclude that these birds, having thus
a very graceful form as their generic standard of taste, a graceful
form with little richness of coloring, would naturally choose
as the loveliest among their mates, not those which showed any
tendency to more bright-hued plumage (which indeed might be
fatal to their safety, by betraying them to their enemies, the falcons
and eagles), but those which most fully embodied and carried
furthest the ideal specific gracefulness of the wading type? ...
Forestine flower-feeders and fruit-eaters, especially in the
tropics, are almost always brightly colored. Their chromatic
taste seems to get quickened in their daily search for food
among the beautiful blossoms and brilliant fruits of southern
woodlands. Thus the humming-birds, the sun-birds, and the
brush-tongued lories, three very dissimilar groups of birds as
far as descent is concerned, all alike feed upon the honey and
the insects which they extract from the large tubular bells of
tropical flowers; and all alike are noticeable for their intense
metallic lustre or pure tones of color. Again, the parrots, the
toucans, the birds of paradise, and many other of the more beautiful
exotic species, are fruit-eaters, and reflect their inherited
taste in their own gaudy plumage. But the waders have no such
special reasons for acquiring a love for bright hues. Hence
their aesthetic feeling seems rather to have taken a turn toward
the further development of their own graceful forms. Even the
plainest wading birds have a certain natural elegance of shape
which supplies a primitive basis for aesthetic selection to work on.</p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_LANE_ALLEN"></a>JAMES LANE ALLEN</h2>

<h3>(1850-)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he literary work of James Lane Allen was begun with maturer
powers and wider culture than most writers exhibit in their
first publications. His mastery of English was acquired with
difficulty, and his knowledge of Latin he obtained through years of
instruction as well as of study. The wholesome open-air atmosphere
which pervades his stories, their pastoral character and love of nature,
come from the tastes bequeathed to him by three generations of
paternal ancestors, easy-going gentlemen farmers of the blue-grass
region of Kentucky. On a farm near Lexington, in this beautiful
country of stately homes, fine herds, and great flocks, the author was
born, and there he spent his childhood and youth.</p>

<p>About 1885 he came to New York to devote himself to literature;
for though he had contributed poems, essays, and criticisms to leading
periodicals, his first important work was a series of articles
descriptive of the &quot;Blue-Grass Region,&quot; published in Harper's Magazine.
The field was new, the work was fresh, and the author's ability
was at once recognized. Inevitably he chose Kentucky for the scene
of his stories, knowing and loving, as he did, her characteristics and
her history. While preparing his articles on 'The Blue-Grass Region,'
he had studied the Trappist Monastery and the Convent of Loretto,
as well as the records of the Catholic Church in Kentucky; and his
first stories, 'The White Cowl' and 'Sister Dolorosa,' which appeared
in the Century Magazine, were the first fruits of this labor. A controversy
arose as to the fairness of these portraitures; but however
opinions may differ as to his characterization, there can be no question
of the truthfulness of the exposition of the mediaeval spirit of
those retreats.</p>

<p>This tendency to use a historic background marks most of Mr.
Allen's stories. In 'The Choir Invisible,' a tale of the last century,
pioneer Kentucky once more exists. The old clergyman of 'Flute
and Violin' lived and died in Lexington, and had been long forgotten
when his story &quot;touched the vanishing halo of a hard and
saintly life.&quot; The old negro preacher, with texts embroidered on his
coat-tails, was another figure of reality, unnoticed until he became
one of the 'Two Gentlemen of Kentucky.' In Lexington lived and
died &quot;King Solomon,&quot; who had almost faded from memory when
his historian found the record of the poor vagabond's heroism during
the plague, and made it memorable in a story that touches the heart
and fills the eyes. 'A Kentucky Cardinal,' with 'Aftermath,' its
second part, is full of history and of historic personages. 'Summer
in Arcady: A Tale of Nature,' the latest of Mr. Allen's stories, is no
less based on local history and no less full of local color than his
other tales, notwithstanding its general unlikeness.</p>

<p>This book sounds a deeper note than the earlier tales, although
the truth which Mr. Allen sees is not mere fidelity to local types, but
the essential truth of human nature. His realism has always a poetic
aspect. Quiet, reserved, out of the common, his books deal with
moods rather than with actions; their problems are spiritual rather
than physical; their thought tends toward the higher and more difficult
way of life.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="A_COURTSHIP"></a>A COURTSHIP</h3>
<center>From 'Summer in Arcady'</center>

<p>The sunlight grew pale the following morning; a shadow crept
rapidly over the blue; bolts darted about the skies like
maddened redbirds; the thunder, ploughing its way down
the dome as along zigzag cracks in the stony street, filled the
caverns of the horizon with reverberations that shook the earth;
and the rain was whirled across the landscape in long, white,
wavering sheets. Then all day quiet and silence throughout
Nature except for the drops, tapping high and low the twinkling
leaves; except for the new melody of woodland and meadow
brooks, late silvery and with a voice only for their pebbles and
moss and mint, but now yellow and brawling and leaping-back
into the grassy channels that were their old-time beds; except
for the indoor music of dripping eaves and rushing gutters and
overflowing rain-barrels. And when at last in the gold of the
cool west the sun broke from the edge of the gray, over what a
green, soaked, fragrant world he reared the arch of Nature's
peace!</p>

<p>Not a little blade of corn in the fields but holds in an emerald
vase its treasures of white gems. The hemp-stalks bend so
low under the weight of their plumes, that were a vesper sparrow
to alight on one for his evening hymn, it would go with
him to the ground. The leaning barley and rye and wheat flash
in the last rays their jeweled beards. Under the old apple-trees,
golden-brown mushrooms are already pushing upward
through the leaf-loam, rank with many an autumn's dropping.
About the yards the peonies fall with faces earthward. In
the stable-lots the larded porkers, with bristles as clean as frost,
and flesh of pinky whiteness, are hunting with nervous nostrils
for the lush purslain. The fowls are driving their bills up and
down their wet breasts. And the farmers who have been shelling
corn for the mill come out of their barns, with their coats
over their shoulders, on the way to supper, look about for the
plough-horses, and glance at the western sky, from which the
last drops are falling.</p>

<p>But soon only a more passionate heat shoots from the sun
into the planet. The plumes of the hemp are so dry again, that
by the pollen shaken from their tops you can trace the young
rabbits making their way out to the dusty paths. The shadows
of white clouds sail over purple stretches of blue-grass, hiding
the sun from the steady eye of the turkey, whose brood is
spread out before her like a fan on the earth. At early morning
the neighing of the stallions is heard around the horizon; at
noon the bull makes the deep, hot pastures echo with his majestic
summons; out in the blazing meadows the butterflies strike
the afternoon air with more impatient wings; under the moon
all night the play of ducks and drakes goes on along the margins
of the ponds. Young people are running away and marrying;
middle-aged farmers surprise their wives by looking in on
them at their butter-making in the sweet dairies; and Nature
is lashing everything--grass, fruit, insects, cattle, human
creatures--more fiercely onward to the fulfillment of her ends. She
is the great heartless haymaker, wasting not a ray of sunshine
on a clod, but caring naught for the light that beats upon a
throne, and holding man and woman, with their longing for immortality,
and their capacities for joy and pain, as of no more
account than a couple of fertilizing nasturtiums.</p>

<p>The storm kept Daphne at home. On the next day the earth
was yellow with sunlight, but there were puddles along the path,
and a branch rushing swollen across the green valley in the
fields. On the third, her mother took the children to town to be
fitted with hats and shoes, and Daphne also, to be freshened up
with various moderate adornments, in view of a protracted meeting
soon to begin. On the fourth, some ladies dropped in to
spend the day, bearing in mind the episode at the dinner, and
having grown curious to watch events accordingly. On the fifth,
her father carried out the idea of cutting down some cedar-trees
in the front yard for fence posts; and whenever he was working
about the house, he kept her near to wait on him in unnecessary
ways. On the sixth, he rode away with two hands and an empty
wagon-bed for some work on the farm; her mother drove off to
another dinner--dinners never cease in Kentucky, and the wife
of an elder is not free to decline invitations; and at last she was
left alone in the front porch, her face turned with burning eagerness
toward the fields. In a little while she had slipped away.</p>

<p>All these days Hilary had been eager to see her. He was
carrying a good many girls in his mind that summer; none in
his heart; but his plans concerning these latter were for the time
forgotten. He hung about that part of his farm from which he
could have descried her in the distance. Each forenoon and
afternoon, at the usual hour of her going to her uncle's, he rode
over and watched for her. Other people passed to and fro,--children
and servants,--but not Daphne; and repeated disappointments
fanned his desire to see her.</p>

<p>When she came into sight at last, he was soon walking beside
her, leading his horse by the reins.</p>

<p>&quot;I have been waiting to see you, Daphne,&quot; he said, with a
smile, but general air of seriousness. &quot;I have been waiting a
long time for a chance to talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I have wanted to see you,&quot; said Daphne, her face
turned away and her voice hardly to be heard. &quot;I have been
waiting for a chance to talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p>The change in her was so great, so unexpected, it contained
an appeal to him so touching, that he glanced quickly at her.
Then he stopped short and looked searchingly around the
meadow.</p>

<p>The thorn-tree is often the only one that can survive on these
pasture lands. Its spikes, even when it is no higher than the
grass, keep off the mouths of grazing stock. As it grows higher,
birds see it standing solitary in the distance and fly to it, as a
resting-place in passing. Some autumn day a seed of the wild
grape is thus dropped near its root; and in time the thorn-tree
and the grape-vine come to thrive together.</p>

<p>As Hilary now looked for some shade to which they could
retreat from the blinding, burning sunlight, he saw one of these
standing off at a distance of a few hundred yards. He slipped
the bridle-reins through the head-stall, and giving his mare a
soft slap on the shoulder, turned her loose to graze.</p>

<p>&quot;Come over here and sit down out of the sun,&quot; he said, starting
off in his authoritative way. &quot;I want to talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p>Daphne followed in his wake, through the deep grass.</p>

<p>When they reached the tree, they sat down under the rayless
boughs. Some sheep lying there ran round to the other side and
stood watching them, with a frightened look in their clear, peaceful
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; he said, fanning his face, and tugging
with his forefinger to loosen his shirt collar from his moist neck.
He had the manner of a powerful comrade who means to succor
a weaker one.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Daphne, like a true woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but there is,&quot; he insisted. &quot;I got you into trouble. I
didn't think of that when I asked you to dance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You had nothing to do with it,&quot; retorted Daphne, with a flash.
&quot;I danced for spite.&quot;</p>

<p>He threw back his head with a peal of laughter. All at once
this was broken off. He sat up, with his eyes fixed on the lower
edge of the meadow.</p>

<p>&quot;Here comes your father,&quot; he said gravely.</p>

<p>Daphne turned. Her father was riding slowly through the
bars. A wagon-bed loaded with rails crept slowly after him.</p>

<p>In an instant the things that had cost her so much toil and
so many tears to arrange,--her explanations, her justifications,
and her parting,--all the reserve and the coldness that she had
laid up in her heart, as one fills high a little ice-house with fear
of far-off summer heat,--all were quite gone, melted away.
And everything that he had planned to tell her was forgotten
also at the sight of that stern figure on horseback bearing unconsciously
down upon them.</p>

<p>&quot;If I had only kept my mouth shut about his old fences,&quot;
he said to himself. &quot;Confound my bull!&quot; and he looked anxiously
at Daphne, who sat with her eyes riveted on her father.
The next moment she had turned, and they were laughing in
each other's faces.</p>

<p>&quot;What shall I do?&quot; she cried, leaning over and burying her
face in her hands, and lifting it again, scarlet with excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't do anything,&quot; he said calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;But Hilary, if he sees us, we are lost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If he sees us, we are found.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he mustn't see me here!&quot; she cried, with something
like real terror. &quot;I believe I'll lie down in the grass. Maybe
he'll think I am a friend of yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My friends all sit up in the grass,&quot; said Hilary.</p>

<p>But Daphne had already hidden.</p>

<p>Many a time, when a little girl, she had amused herself by
screaming like a hawk at the young guineas, and seeing them
cuddle invisible under small tufts and weeds. Out in the stable
lot, where the grass was grazed so close that the geese could
barely nip it, she would sometimes get one of the negro men
to scare the little pigs, for the delight of seeing them squat as
though hidden, when they were no more hidden than if they
had spread themselves out upon so many dinner dishes. All of
us reveal traces of this primitive instinct upon occasion. Daphne
was doing her best to hide now.</p>

<p>When Hilary realized it he moved in front of her, screening
her as well as possible.</p>

<p>&quot;Hadn't you better lie down, too?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he replied quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;But if he sees you, he might take a notion to ride over this
way!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then he'll have to ride.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Hilary, suppose he were to find me lying down here
behind you, hiding?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then he'll have to find you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You get me into trouble, and then you won't help me out!&quot;
exclaimed Daphne with considerable heat.</p>

<p>&quot;It might not make matters any better for me to hide,&quot; he
answered quietly. &quot;But if he comes over here and tries to get
us into trouble, I'll see then what I can do.&quot;</p>

<p>Daphne lay silent for a moment, thinking. Then she nestled
more closely down, and said with gay, unconscious archness:
&quot;I'm not hiding because I'm afraid of him. I'm doing it just
because I want to.&quot;</p>

<p>She did not know that the fresh happiness flushing her at
that moment came from the fact of having Hilary between herself
and her father as a protector; that she was drinking in the
delight a woman feels in getting playfully behind the man she
loves in the face of danger: but her action bound her to him
and brought her more under his influence.</p>

<p>His words showed that he also felt his position,--the position
of the male who stalks forth from the herd and stands the silent
challenger. He was young, and vain of his manhood in the
usual innocent way that led him to carry the chip on his
shoulder for the world to knock off; and he placed himself
before Daphne with the understanding that if they were discovered,
there would be trouble. Her father was a violent man,
and the circumstances were not such that any Kentucky father
would overlook them. But with his inward seriousness, his face
wore its usual look of reckless unconcern.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he coming this way?&quot; asked Daphne, after an interval of
impatient waiting.</p>

<p>&quot;Straight ahead. Are you hid?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't see whether I'm hid or not. Where is he now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right on us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does he see you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think he sees me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I might as well get up,&quot; said Daphne, with the courage
of despair, and up she got. Her father was riding along
the path in front of them, but not looking. She was down
again like a partridge.</p>

<p>&quot;How could you fool me, Hilary? Suppose he <i>had</i> been
looking!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what he thinks I'm doing, sitting over here in the
grass like a stump,&quot; said Hilary. &quot;If he takes me for one, he
must think I've got an awful lot of roots.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me when it's time to get up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned softly toward her. She was lying on her side, with
her burning cheek in one hand. The other hand rested high on
the curve of her hip. Her braids had fallen forward, and lay in
a heavy loop about her lovely shoulders. Her eyes were closed,
her scarlet lips parted in a smile. The edges of her snow-white
petticoats showed beneath her blue dress, and beyond these one
of her feet and ankles. Nothing more fragrant with innocence
ever lay on the grass.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it time to get up now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet,&quot; and he sat bending over her.</p>

<p>&quot;Now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet,&quot; he repeated more softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>His voice thrilled her, and she glanced up at him. His laughing
eyes were glowing down upon her under his heavy mat of
hair. She sat up and looked toward the wagon crawling away in
the distance; her father was no longer in sight.</p>

<p>One of the ewes, dissatisfied with a back view, stamped her
forefoot impatiently, and ran round in front, and out into the
sun. Her lambs followed, and the three, ranging themselves
abreast, stared at Daphne, with a look of helpless inquiry.</p>

<p>&quot;Sh-pp-pp!&quot; she cried, throwing up her hands at them, irritated.
&quot;Go away!&quot;</p>

<p>They turned and ran; the others followed; and the whole
number, falling into line, took a path meekly homeward. They
left a greater sense of privacy under the tree. Several yards off
was a small stock-pond. Around the edge of this the water
stood hot and green in the tracks of the cattle and the sheep,
and about these pools the yellow butterflies were thick, alighting
daintily on the promontories of the mud, or rising two by two
through the dazzling atmosphere in columns of enamored flight.</p>

<p>Daphne leaned over to the blue grass where it swayed unbroken
in the breeze, and drew out of their sockets several stalks
of it, bearing on their tops the purplish seed-vessels. With them
she began to braid a ring about one of her fingers in the old
simple fashion of the country.</p>

<p>As they talked, he lay propped on his elbow, watching her
fingers, the soft slow movements of which little by little wove a
spell over his eyes. And once again the power of her beauty
began to draw him beyond control. He felt a desire to seize her
hands, to crush them in his. His eyes passed upward along her
tapering wrists, the skin of which was like mother-of-pearl; upward
along the arm to the shoulder--to her neck--to her deeply
crimsoned cheeks--to the purity of her brow--to the purity of
her eyes, the downcast lashes of which hid them like conscious
fringes.</p>

<p>An awkward silence began to fall between them. Daphne
felt that the time had come for her to speak. But, powerless
to begin, she feigned to busy herself all the more devotedly
with braiding the deep-green circlet. Suddenly he drew himself
through the grass to her side.</p>

<p>&quot;Let <i>me</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; she cried, lifting her arm above his reach and looking
at him with a gay threat. &quot;You don't know how.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do know how,&quot; he said, with his white teeth on his red
underlip, and his eyes sparkling; and reaching upward, he laid
his hand in the hollow of her elbow and pulled her arm down.</p>

<p>&quot;No! No!&quot; she cried again, putting her hands behind her
back. &quot;You will spoil it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will not spoil it,&quot; he said, moving so close to her that his
breath was on her face, and reaching round to unclasp her hands.</p>

<p>&quot;No! No! No!&quot; she cried, bending away from him. &quot;I don't
want any ring!&quot; and she tore it from her finger and threw it out
on the grass. Then she got up, and, brushing the grass-seed off
her lap, put on her hat.</p>

<p>He sat cross-legged on the grass before her. He had put on
his hat, and the brim hid his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;And you are not going to stay and talk to me?&quot; he said in
a tone of reproachfulness, without looking up.</p>

<p>She was excited and weak and trembling, and so she put out
her hand and took hold of a strong loop of the grape-vine hanging
from a branch of the thorn, and laid her cheek against her
hand and looked away from him.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you were better than the others,&quot; he continued,
with the bitter wisdom of twenty years. &quot;But you women are
all alike. When a man gets into trouble, you desert him. You
hurry him on to the devil. I have been turned out of the
church, and now you are down on me. Oh, well! But you
know how much I have always liked you, Daphne.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not the first time he had acted this character. It had
been a favorite role. But Daphne had never seen the like. She
was overwhelmed with happiness that he cared so much for her;
and to have him reproach her for indifference, and see him suffering
with the idea that she had turned against him--that
instantly changed the whole situation. He had not heard then
what had taken place at the dinner. Under the circumstances,
feeling certain that the secret of her love had not been discovered,
she grew emboldened to risk a little more.</p>

<p>So she turned toward him smiling, and swayed gently as she
clung to the vine.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; I have my orders not even to speak to you! Never
again!&quot; she said, with the air of tantalizing.</p>

<p>&quot;Then stay with me a while now,&quot; he said, and lifted slowly
to her his appealing face. She sat down, and screened herself
with a little feminine transparency.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't stay long: it's going to rain!&quot;</p>

<p>He cast a wicked glance at the sky from under his hat; there
were a few clouds on the horizon.</p>

<p>&quot;And so you are never going to speak to me again?&quot; he
said mournfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Never!&quot; How delicious her laughter was.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll put a ring on your finger to remember me by.&quot;</p>

<p>He lay over in the grass and pulled several stalks. Then he
lifted his eyes beseechingly to hers.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you let me?&quot;</p>

<p>Daphne hid her hands. He drew himself to her side and
took one of them forcibly from her lap.</p>

<p>With a slow, caressing movement he began to braid the
grass ring around her finger--in and out, around and around,
his fingers laced with her fingers, his palm lying close upon her
palm, his blood tingling through the skin upon her blood. He
made the braiding go wrong, and took it off and began over
again. Two or three times she drew a deep breath, and stole a
bewildered look at his face, which was so close to hers that his
hair brushed it--so close that she heard the quiver of his own
breath. Then all at once he folded his hands about hers with a
quick, fierce tenderness, and looked up at her. She turned her
face aside and tried to draw her hand away. His clasp tightened.
She snatched it away, and got up with a nervous laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at the butterflies! Aren't they pretty?&quot;</p>

<p>He sprang up and tried to seize her hand again.</p>

<p>&quot;You shan't go home yet!&quot; he said, in an undertone.</p>

<p>&quot;Shan't I?&quot; she said, backing away from him. &quot;Who's
going to keep me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I am</i>,&quot; he said, laughing excitedly and following her closely.</p>

<p>&quot;My father's coming!&quot; she cried out as a warning.</p>

<p>He turned and looked: there was no one in sight.</p>

<p>&quot;He <i>is</i> coming--sooner or later!&quot; she called.</p>

<p>She had retreated several yards off into the sunlight of the
meadow.</p>

<p>The remembrance of the risk that he was causing her to run
checked him. He went over to her.</p>

<p>&quot;When can I see you again--soon?&quot;</p>

<p>He had never spoken so seriously to her before. He had
never before been so serious. But within the last hour Nature
had been doing her work, and its effect was immediate. His
sincerity instantly conquered her. Her eyes fell.</p>

<p>&quot;No one has any right to keep us from seeing each other!&quot;
he insisted. &quot;We must settle that for ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>Daphne made no reply.</p>

<p>&quot;But we can't meet here any more--with people passing
backward and forward!&quot; he continued rapidly and decisively.
&quot;What has happened to-day mustn't happen again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; she replied, in a voice barely to be heard. &quot;It must
never happen again. We can't meet here.&quot;</p>

<p>They were walking side by side now toward the meadow-path.
As they reached it he paused.</p>

<p>&quot;Come to the back of the pasture--to-morrow!--at four
o'clock!&quot; he said, tentatively, recklessly.</p>

<p>Daphne did not answer as she moved away from him along
the path homeward.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you come?&quot; he called out to her.</p>

<p>She turned and shook her head. Whatever her own new
plans may have become, she was once more happy and laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, Daphne!&quot;</p>

<p>She walked several paces further and turned and shook her
head again.</p>

<p>&quot;Come!&quot; he pleaded.</p>

<p>She laughed at him.</p>

<p>He wheeled round to his mare grazing near. As he put his
foot into the stirrup, he looked again: she was standing in the
same place, laughing still.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>You</i> go,&quot; she cried, waving him good-by. &quot;There'll not be
a soul to disturb you! To-morrow--at four o'clock!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you be there?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you?&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be there to-morrow,&quot; he said, &quot;and every other day till
you come.&quot;</p>

<h3><a name="OLD_KING_SOLOMON'S_CORONATION"></a>OLD KING SOLOMON'S CORONATION</h3>

<p>From 'Flute and Violin, and Other Kentucky Tales and Romances'
1891, by Harper and Brothers.</p>

<p>He stood on the topmost of the court-house steps, and for a
moment looked down on the crowd with the usual air of
official severity.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he then cried out sharply, &quot;by an ordah of the
cou't I now offah this man at public sale to the highes' biddah.
He is able-bodied but lazy, without visible property or means of
suppoht, an' of dissolute habits. He is therefoh adjudged guilty
of high misdemeanahs, an' is to be sole into labah foh a twelvemonth.
How much, then, am I offahed foh the vagrant? How
much am I offahed foh ole King Sol'mon?&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing was offered for old King Solomon. The spectators
formed themselves into a ring around the big vagrant, and settled
down to enjoy the performance.</p>

<p>&quot;Staht 'im, somebody.&quot;</p>

<p>Somebody started a laugh, which rippled around the circle.</p>

<p>The sheriff looked on with an expression of unrelaxed severity,
but catching the eye of an acquaintance on the outskirts, he exchanged
a lightning wink of secret appreciation. Then he lifted
off his tight beaver hat, wiped out of his eyes a little shower of
perspiration which rolled suddenly down from above, and warmed
a degree to his theme.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, gentlemen,&quot; he said more suasively, &quot;it's too hot to
stan' heah all day. Make me an offah! You all know ole King
Sol'mon; don't wait to be interduced. How much, then, to staht
'im? Say fifty dollahs! Twenty-five! Fifteen! Ten! Why,
gentlemen! Not <i>ten</i> dollahs? Remembah, this is the Blue-Grass
Region of Kentucky--the land of Boone an' Kenton, the home
of Henry Clay!&quot; he added, in an oratorical <i>crescendo</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;He ain't wuth his victuals,&quot; said an oily little tavern-keeper,
folding his arms restfully over his own stomach and cocking up
one piggish eye into his neighbor's face. &quot;He ain't wuth his
'taters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buy 'im foh 'is rags!&quot; cried a young law student, with a
Blackstone under his arm, to the town rag picker opposite, who
was unconsciously ogling the vagrant's apparel.</p>

<p>&quot;I <i>might</i> buy 'im foh 'is <i>scalp</i>,&quot; drawled a farmer, who had
taken part in all kinds of scalp contests, and was now known to
be busily engaged in collecting crow scalps for a match soon to
come off between two rival counties.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I'll buy 'im foh a hat sign,&quot; said a manufacturer of
ten-dollar Castor and Rhorum hats. This sally drew merry attention
to the vagrant's hat, and the merchant felt rewarded.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd bettah say the town ought to buy 'im an' put 'im up
on top of the cou't-house as a scarecrow foh the cholera,&quot; said
some one else.</p>

<p>&quot;What news of the cholera did the stage coach bring this
mohning?&quot; quickly inquired his neighbor in his ear; and the two
immediately fell into low, grave talk, forgot the auction, and
turned away.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop, gentlemen, stop!&quot; cried the sheriff, who had watched
the rising tide of good humor, and now saw his chance to float
in on it with spreading sails. &quot;You're runnin' the price in the
wrong direction--down, not up. The law requires that he be
sole to the highes' biddah, not the lowes'. As loyal citizens,
uphole the constitution of the commonwealth of Kentucky an'
make me an offah; the man is really a great bargain. In the
first place, he would cos' his ownah little or nothin', because, as
you see, he keeps himself in cigahs an' clo'es; then, his main
article of diet is whisky--a supply of which he always has on
ban'. He don't even need a bed, foh you know he sleeps jus'
as well on any doohstep; noh a chair, foh he prefers to sit roun'
on the curbstones. Remembah, too, gentlemen, that ole King
Sol'mon is a Virginian--from the same neighbohhood as Mr.
Clay. Remembah that he is well educated, that he is an <i>awful</i>
Whig, an' that he has smoked mo' of the stumps of Mr. Clay's
cigahs than any other man in existence. If you don't b'lieve <i>me,</i>
gentlemen, yondah goes Mr. Clay now; call <i>him</i> ovah an' ask
'im foh yo'se'ves.&quot;</p>

<p>He paused, and pointed with his right forefinger towards
Main Street, along which the spectators, with a sudden craning
of necks, beheld the familiar figure of the passing statesman.</p>

<p>&quot;But you don't need <i>any</i>body to tell these fac's, gentlemen,&quot;
he continued. &quot;You merely need to be reminded that ole King
Sol'mon is no ohdinary man. Mo'ovah he has a kine heaht; he
nevah spoke a rough wohd to anybody in this worl', an' he is as
proud as Tecumseh of his good name an' charactah. An', gentlemen,&quot;
he added, bridling with an air of mock gallantry and laying
a hand on his heart, &quot;if anythin' fu'thah is required in the
way of a puffect encomium, we all know that there isn't anothah
man among us who cuts as wide a swath among the ladies.
The'foh, if you have any appreciation of virtue, any magnanimity
of heaht; if you set a propah valuation upon the descendants of
Virginia, that mothah of Presidents; if you believe in the pure
laws of Kentucky as the pioneer bride of the Union; if you love
America an' love the worl'--make me a gen'rous, high-toned
offah foh ole King Sol'mon!&quot;</p>

<p>He ended his peroration amid a shout of laughter and applause,
and feeling satisfied that it was a good time for returning
to a more practical treatment of his subject, proceeded in a sincere
tone:--</p>

<p>&quot;He can easily earn from one to two dollahs a day, an' from
three to six hundred a yeah. There's not anothah white man in
town capable of doin' as much work. There's not a niggah ban'
in the hemp factories with such muscles an' such a chest. <i>Look</i>
at 'em! An', if you don't b'lieve me, step fo'ward and <i>feel</i> 'em.
How much, then, is bid foh 'im?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One dollah!&quot; said the owner of a hemp factory, who had
walked forward and felt the vagrant's arm, laughing, but coloring
up also as the eyes of all were quickly turned upon him. In
those days it was not an unheard-of thing for the muscles of a
human being to be thus examined when being sold into servitude
to a new master.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; cried the sheriff, cheerily. &quot;One precinc'
heard from! One dollah! I am offahed one dollah foh ole King
Sol'mon. One dollah foh the king! Make it a half. One dollah
an' a half. Make it a half. One dol-dol-dol-dollah!&quot;</p>

<p>Two medical students, returning from lectures at the old Medical
Hall, now joined the group, and the sheriff explained:</p>

<p>&quot;One dollah is bid foh the vagrant ole King Sol'mon, who is
to be sole into labah foh a twelvemonth. Is there any othah
bid? Are you all done? One dollah, once--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dollah and a half,&quot; said one of the students, and remarked
half jestingly under his breath to his companion, &quot;I'll buy him
on the chance of his dying. We'll dissect him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would you own his body if he <i>should</i> die?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If he dies while bound to me, I'll arrange <i>that</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One dollah an' a half,&quot; resumed the sheriff, and falling into
the tone of a facile auctioneer he rattled on:--</p>

<p>&quot;One dollah an' a half foh ole Sol'mon--sol, sol, sol,--do, re,
mi, fa, sol,--do, re, mi, fa, sol! Why, gentlemen, you can set
the king to music!&quot;</p>

<p>All this time the vagrant had stood in the centre of that close
ring of jeering and humorous bystanders--a baffling text from
which to have preached a sermon on the infirmities of our imperfect
humanity. Some years before, perhaps as a master-stroke of
derision, there had been given to him that title which could but
heighten the contrast of his personality and estate with every
suggestion of the ancient sacred magnificence; and never had the
mockery seemed so fine as at this moment, when he was led
forth into the streets to receive the lowest sentence of the law
upon his poverty and dissolute idleness. He was apparently in
the very prime of life--a striking figure, for nature at least had
truly done some royal work on him. Over six feet in height,
erect, with limbs well shaped and sinewy, with chest and neck full
of the lines of great power, a large head thickly covered with long,
reddish hair, eyes blue, face beardless, complexion fair but discolored
by low passions and excesses--such was old King Solomon.
He wore a stiff, high, black Castor hat of the period, with
the crown smashed in and the torn rim hanging down over one
ear; a black cloth coat in the old style, ragged and buttonless; a
white cotton shirt, with the broad collar crumpled wide open at
the neck and down his sunburnt bosom; blue jean pantaloons,
patched at the seat and the knees; and ragged cotton socks that
fell down over the tops of his dusty shoes, which were open at
the heels.</p>

<p>In one corner of his sensual mouth rested the stump of a
cigar. Once during the proceedings he had produced another,
lighted it, and continued quietly smoking. If he took to himself
any shame as the central figure of this ignoble performance, no
one knew it. There was something almost royal in his unconcern.
The humor, the badinage, the open contempt, of which he
was the public target, fell thick and fast upon him, but as harmlessly
as would balls of pith upon a coat of mail. In truth, there
was that in his great, lazy, gentle, good-humored bulk and bearing
which made the gibes seem all but despicable. He shuffled
from one foot to the other as though he found it a trial to stand
up so long, but all the while looking the spectators full in the
eyes without the least impatience. He suffered the man of the
factory to walk round him and push and pinch his muscles as
calmly as though he had been the show bull at a country fair.
Once only, when the sheriff had pointed across the street at the
figure of Mr. Clay, he had looked quickly in that direction with
a kindling light in his eye and a passing flush on his face. For
the rest, he seemed like a man who has drained his cup of human
life and has nothing left him but to fill again and drink without
the least surprise or eagerness.</p>

<p>The bidding between the man of the factory and the student
had gone slowly on. The price had reached ten dollars. The
heat was intense, the sheriff tired. Then something occurred to
revivify the scene. Across the market place and toward the steps
of the court-house there suddenly came trundling along in breathless
haste a huge old negress, carrying on one arm a large shallow
basket containing apple-crab lanterns and fresh gingerbread.
With a series of half-articulate grunts and snorts she approached
the edge of the crowd and tried to force her way through. She
coaxed, she begged, she elbowed and pushed and scolded, now
laughing, and now with the passion of tears in her thick, excited
voice. All at once, catching sight of the sheriff, she lifted one
ponderous brown arm, naked to the elbow, and waved her hand
to him above the heads of those in front.</p>

<p>&quot;Hole on marster! hole on!&quot; she cried in a tone of humorous
entreaty. &quot;Don' knock 'im off till I come! Gim <i>me</i> a bid at 'im!&quot;</p>

<p>The sheriff paused and smiled. The crowd made way tumultuously,
with broad laughter and comment.</p>

<p>&quot;Stan' aside theah an' let Aun' Charlotte in!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Now</i> you'll see biddin'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get out of the way foh Aun' Charlotte!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Up, my free niggah! Hurrah foh Kentucky.&quot;</p>

<p>A moment more and she stood inside the ring of spectators,
her basket on the pavement at her feet, her hands plumped
akimbo into her fathomless sides, her head up, and her soft,
motherly eyes turned eagerly upon the sheriff. Of the crowd
she seemed unconscious, and on the vagrant before her she had
not cast a single glance.</p>

<p>She was dressed with perfect neatness. A red and yellow
Madras kerchief was bound about her head in a high coil, and
another over the bosom of her stiffly starched and smoothly
ironed blue cottonade dress. Rivulets of perspiration ran down
over her nose, her temples, and around her ears, and disappeared
mysteriously in the creases of her brown neck. A single drop
accidentally hung glistening like a diamond on the circlet of one
of her large brass earrings.</p>

<p>The sheriff looked at her a moment, smiling but a little disconcerted.
The spectacle was unprecedented.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want heah, Aun' Charlotte?&quot; he asked kindly.
&quot;You can't sell yo' pies an' gingerbread heah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don' <i>wan</i>' sell no pies en gingerbread,&quot; she replied, contemptuously.
&quot;I wan' bid on <i>him</i>,&quot; and she nodded sidewise at
the vagrant. &quot;White folks allers sellin' niggahs to wuk fuh
<i>dem</i>; I gwine to buy a white man to wuk fuh <i>me</i>. En he
gwine t' git a mighty hard mistiss, you heah <i>me</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>The eyes of the sheriff twinkled with delight.</p>

<p>&quot;Ten dollahs is offahed foh ole King Sol'mon. Is theah any
othah bid. Are you all done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leben,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Two young ragamuffins crawled among the legs of the crowd
up to her basket and filched pies and cake beneath her very
nose.</p>

<p>&quot;Twelve!&quot; cried the student, laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Thirteen!&quot; she laughed, too, but her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>You are bidding against a niggah</i>&quot; whispered the student's
companion in his ear.</p>

<p>&quot;So I am; let's be off,&quot; answered the other, with a hot flush
on his proud face.</p>

<p>Thus the sale was ended, and the crowd variously dispersed.
In a distant corner of the courtyard the ragged urchins were
devouring their unexpected booty. The old negress drew a red
handkerchief out of her bosom, untied a knot in a corner of it,
and counted out the money to the sheriff. Only she and the
vagrant were now left on the spot.</p>

<p>&quot;You have bought me. What do you want me to do?&quot; he
asked quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Lohd, honey!&quot; she answered, in a low tone of affectionate
chiding, &quot;I don' wan' you to do <i>no thin</i>'! I wuzn' gwine t' 'low
dem white folks to buy you. Dey'd wuk you till you dropped
dead. You go 'long en do ez you please.&quot;</p>

<p>She gave a cunning chuckle of triumph in thus setting at
naught the ends of justice, and in a voice rich and musical
with affection, she said, as she gave him a little push:</p>

<p>&quot;You bettah be gittin' out o' dis blazin' sun. G' on home! I
be 'long by-en-by.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned and moved slowly away in the direction of Water
Street, where she lived; and she, taking up her basket, shuffled
across the market place toward Cheapside, muttering to herself
the while:</p>

<p>&quot;I come mighty nigh gittin' dar too late, foolin' long wid
dese pies. Sellin' <i>him</i> 'ca'se he don' wuk! Umph! if all de men
in dis town dat don' wuk wuz to be tuk up en sole, d' wouldn'
be 'nough money in de town to buy em! Don' I see 'em settin'
'roun' dese taverns f'om mohnin' till night?&quot;</p>

<p>Nature soon smiles upon her own ravages and strews our
graves with flowers, not as memories, but for other flowers when
the spring returns.</p>

<p>It was one cool, brilliant morning late in that autumn. The
air blew fresh and invigorating, as though on the earth there
were no corruption, no death. Far southward had flown the
plague. A spectator in the open court square might have seen
many signs of life returning to the town. Students hurried
along, talking eagerly. Merchants met for the first time and
spoke of the winter trade. An old negress, gayly and neatly
dressed, came into the market place, and sitting down on a sidewalk
displayed her yellow and red apples and fragrant gingerbread.
She hummed to herself an old cradle-song, and in
her soft, motherly black eyes shone a mild, happy radiance. A
group of young ragamuffins eyed her longingly from a distance.
Court was to open for the first time since the spring. The
hour was early, and one by one the lawyers passed slowly in.
On the steps of the court-house three men were standing:
Thomas Brown, the sheriff; old Peter Leuba, who had just
walked over from his music store on Main Street; and little
M. Giron, the French confectioner. Each wore mourning on his
hat, and their voices were low and grave.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; the sheriff was saying, &quot;it was on this very
spot the day befoah the cholera broke out that I sole 'im as a
vagrant. An' I did the meanes' thing a man can evah do. I
hel' 'im up to public ridicule foh his weakness an' made spoht
of 'is infirmities. I laughed at 'is povahty an' 'is ole clo'es. I
delivahed on 'im as complete an oration of sarcastic detraction
as I could prepare on the spot, out of my own meanness an'
with the vulgah sympathies of the crowd. Gentlemen, if I only
had that crowd heah now, an' ole King Sol'mon standin' in the
midst of it, that I might ask 'im to accept a humble public
apology, offahed from the heaht of one who feels himself unworthy
to shake 'is han'! But gentlemen, that crowd will nevah
reassemble. Neahly ev'ry man of them is dead, an' ole King
Sol'mon buried them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He buried my friend Adolphe Xaupi,&quot; said Fran&ccedil;ois Giron,
touching his eyes with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>&quot;There is a case of my best Jamaica rum for him whenever
he comes for it,&quot; said old Leuba, clearing his throat.</p>

<p>&quot;But, gentlemen, while we are speakin' of ole King Sol'mon
we ought not to forget who it is that has suppohted 'im. Yondah
she sits on the sidewalk, sellin' 'er apples an' gingerbread.&quot;</p>

<p>The three men looked in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>&quot;Heah comes ole King Sol'mon now,&quot; exclaimed the sheriff.</p>

<p>Across the open square the vagrant was seen walking slowly
along with his habitual air of quiet, unobtrusive preoccupation.
A minute more and he had come over and passed into the court-house
by a side door.</p>

<p>&quot;Is Mr. Clay to be in court to-day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is expected, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then let's go in: there will be a crowd.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know: so many are dead.&quot;</p>

<p>They turned and entered and found seats as quietly as possible;
for a strange and sorrowful hush brooded over the court-room.
Until the bar assembled, it had not been realized how
many were gone. The silence was that of a common overwhelming
disaster. No one spoke with his neighbor; no one
observed the vagrant as he entered and made his way to a seat
on one of the meanest benches, a little apart from the others.
He had not sat there since the day of his indictment for
vagrancy. The judge took his seat, and making a great effort
to control himself, passed his eyes slowly over the court-room.
All at once he caught sight of old King Solomon sitting against
the wall in an obscure corner; and before any one could know
what he was doing, he had hurried down and walked up to the
vagrant and grasped his hand. He tried to speak, but could not.
Old King Solomon had buried his wife and daughter,--buried
them one clouded midnight, with no one present but himself.</p>

<p>Then the oldest member of the bar started up and followed
the example; and then the other members, rising by a common
impulse, filed slowly back and one by one wrung that hard and
powerful hand. After them came the other persons in the court-room.
The vagrant, the gravedigger, had risen and stood
against the wall, at first with a white face and a dazed expression,
not knowing what it meant; afterwards, when he understood
it, his head dropped suddenly forward and his tears fell
thick and hot upon the hands that he could not see. And his
were not the only tears. Not a man in the long file but paid
his tribute of emotion as he stepped forward to honor that
image of sadly eclipsed but still effulgent humanity. It was not
grief, it was not gratitude, nor any sense of making reparation
for the past. It was the softening influence of an act of heroism,
which makes every man feel himself a brother hand in
hand with every other;--such power has a single act of moral
greatness to reverse the relations of men, lifting up one, and
bringing all others to do him homage.</p>

<p>It was the coronation scene in the life of 'Ole' King Solomon
of Kentucky.</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_ALLINGHAM"></a>WILLIAM ALLINGHAM</h2>

<h3>(1828-1889)</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-e.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>ach form of verse has, in addition to its laws of structure, a
subtle quality as difficult to define as the perfume of a
flower. The poem, 'An Evening,' given below, may be
classified both as a song and as a lyric; yet it needs no music other
than its own rhythms, and the full close to each verse which falls
upon the ear like a soft and final chord ending a musical composition.
A light touch and a feeling for shades of meaning are required
to execute such dainty verse. In 'St. Margaret's Eve,' and in many
other ballads, Allingham expresses the broader, more dramatic sweep
of the ballad, and reveals his Celtic ancestry.</p>

<p>The lovable Irishman, William Allingham, worked hard to enter
the brotherhood of poets. When he was only fourteen his father
took him from school to become clerk in the town bank of which he
himself was manager. &quot;The books which he had to keep for the
next seven years were not those on which his heart was set,&quot; says
Mr. George Birkbeck Hill. But this fortune is almost an inevitable
part, and probably not the worst part, of the training for a literary
vocation; and he justified his ambitions by pluckily studying alone
till he had mastered Greek, Latin, French, and German.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill, in his 'Letters of D.G. Rossetti' (Atlantic Monthly,
May, 1896), thus quotes Allingham's own delightful description of his
early home at Ballyshannon, County Donegal:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;The little old town where I was born has a voice of its own, low, solemn,
persistent, humming through the air day and night, summer and winter.
Whenever I think of that town I seem to hear the voice. The river which
makes it rolls over rocky ledges into the tide. Before spreads a great ocean in
sunshine or storm; behind stretches a many-islanded lake. On the south runs
a wavy line of blue mountains; and on the north, over green rocky hills rise
peaks of a more distant range. The trees hide in glens or cluster near the
river; gray rocks and bowlders lie scattered about the windy pastures. The
sky arches wide over all, giving room to multitudes of stars by night, and
long processions of clouds blown from the sea; but also, in the childish memory
where these pictures live, to deeps of celestial blue in the endless days of
summer. An odd, out-of-the-way little town, ours, on the extreme western
edge of Europe; our next neighbors, sunset way, being citizens of the great
new republic, which indeed, to our imagination, seemed little if at all farther
off than England in the opposite direction.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Of the cottage in which he spent most of his childhood and
youth he writes:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Opposite the hall door a good-sized walnut-tree leaned its wrinkled stem
towards the house, and brushed some of the second-story panes with its
broad, fragrant leaves. To sit at that little upper window when it was open to
a summer twilight, and the great tree rustled gently, and sent one leafy spray
so far that it even touched my face, was an enchantment beyond all telling.
Killarney, Switzerland, Venice, could not, in later life, come near it. On three
sides the cottage looked on flowers and branches, which I count as one of the
fortunate chances of my childhood; the sense of natural beauty thus receiving
its due share of nourishment, and of a kind suitable to those early years.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>At last a position in the Customs presented itself:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;In the spring of 1846 I gladly took leave forever of discount ledgers
and current accounts, and went to Belfast for two months' instruction in the
duties of Principal Coast Officer of Customs; a tolerably well-sounding title,
but which carried with it a salary of but &pound;80 a year. I trudged daily about
the docks and timber-yards, learning to measure logs, piles of planks, and,
more troublesome, ships for tonnage; indoors, part of the time practiced customs
book-keeping, and talked to the clerks about literature and poetry in a
way that excited some astonishment, but on the whole, as I found at parting,
a certain degree of curiosity and respect. I preached Tennyson to them.
My spare time was mostly spent in reading and haunting booksellers' shops
where, I venture to say, I laid out a good deal more than most people, in proportion
to my income, and managed to get glimpses of many books which I
could not afford or did not care to buy. I enjoyed my new position, on the
whole, without analysis, as a great improvement on the bank; and for the
rest, my inner mind was brimful of love and poetry, and usually all external
things appeared trivial save in their relation to it.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Of Allingham's early song-writing, his friend Arthur Hughes
says:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Rossetti, and I think Allingham himself, told me, in the early days of our
acquaintance, how in remote Ballyshannon, where he was a clerk in the Customs,
in evening walks he would hear the Irish girls at their cottage doors
singing old ballads, which he would pick up. If they were broken or incomplete,
he would add to them or finish them; if they were improper he would
refine them. He could not get them sung till he got the Dublin Catnach of
that day to print them, on long strips of blue paper, like old songs, and if
about the sea, with the old rough woodcut of a ship on the top. He either
gave them away or they were sold in the neighborhood. Then, in his evening
walks, he had at last the pleasure of hearing some of his own ballads sung at
the cottage doors by the blooming lasses, who were quite unaware that it was
the author who was passing by.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>In 1850 Allingham published a small volume of lyrics whose freshness
and delicacy seemed to announce a new singer, and four years
later his 'Day and Night Songs' strengthened this impression.
Stationed as revenue officer in various parts of England, he wrote
much verse, and published also the 'The Rambles of Patricius Walker,'
a collection of essays upon his walks through England; 'Lawrence
Bloomfield in Ireland,' the tale of a young landlord's efforts to
improve the condition of his tenantry; an anthology, 'Nightingale
Valley' (1862), and an excellent collection of English ballads, 'The
Ballad Book' (1865).</p>

<p>In 1870 he gladly embraced an opportunity to leave the Customs
for the position of assistant editor of Fraser's Magazine under Froude,
whom he afterward succeeded as editor. He was now a member of
a brilliant literary circle, knew Tennyson, Ruskin, and Carlyle, and
was admitted into the warm friendship of the Pre-Raphaelites. But
in no way does he reflect the Pre-Raphaelite spirit by which he was
surrounded; nor does he write his lyrics in the metres and rhythms
of mediaeval France. He is as oblivious of rondeaux, ballades, and
roundels, as he is of fair damosels with cygnet necks and full pomegranate
lips. He is a child of nature, whose verse is free from all
artificial inspiration or expression, and seems to flow easily, clearly,
and tenderly from his pen. Some of it errs in being too fanciful.
In the Flower-Songs, indeed, he sometimes becomes trivial in his
comparison of each English poet to a special flower; but his poetry
is usually sincere with an undercurrent of pathos, as in 'The Ruined
Chapel,' 'The Winter Pear,' and the 'Song.' For lightness of touch
and aerial grace, 'The Bubble' will bear comparison with any verse
of its own <i>genre</i>. 'Robin Redbreast' has many delightful lines; and
in 'The Fairies' one is taken into the realm of Celtic folklore, which
is Allingham's inheritance, where the Brownies, the Pixies, and the
Leprechauns trip over the dew-spangled meadows, or dance on the
yellow sands, and then vanish away in fantastic mists. Quite different
is 'Lovely Mary Donnelly,' which is a sample of the popular songs
that made him a favorite in his own country.</p>

<p>After his death at Hampstead in 1889, his body was cremated
according to his wish, when these lines of his own were read:--</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Body to purifying flame,<br>
Soul to the Great Deep whence it came,<br>
Leaving a song on earth below,<br>
An urn of ashes white as snow.&quot;<br>

<h2><a name="KARL_JONAS_LUDVIG_ALMQUIST"></a>KARL JONAS LUDVIG ALMQUIST</h2>

<h3>(1793-1866)</h3>
<br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>lmquist, one of the most versatile writers of Sweden, was a
man of strange contrasts, a genius as uncertain as a will-o'-the-wisp.
His contemporary, the famous poet and critic
Atterbom, writes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;What did the great poets of past times possess which upheld them under
even the bitterest worldly circumstances? Two things: one a strong and
conscientious will, the other a single--not double, much less
manifold--determination for their work, oneness. They were not self-seekers; they sought,
they worshiped something better than themselves. The aim which stood
dimly before their inmost souls was not the enjoyment of flattered vanity; it
was a high, heroic symbol of love of honor and love of country, of heavenly
wisdom. For this they thought it worth while to fight, for this they even
thought it worth while to suffer, without finding the suffering in itself strange,
or calling earth to witness thereof.... The writer of 'T&ouml;rnrosens Bok'
[The Book of the Rose] is one of these few; he does therefore already reign
over a number of youthful hearts, and out of them will rise his time of honor,
a time when many of the celebrities of the present moment will have faded
away.&quot;

<p>Almquist was born in Stockholm in 1793. When still a very
young man he obtained a good official position, but gave it up in
1823 to lead a colony of friends into the forests of V&auml;rmland, where
they intended to return to a primitive life close to the heart of
nature. He called this colony a &quot;Man's-home Association,&quot; and
ordained that in the primeval forest the members should live in turf-covered
huts, wear homespun, eat porridge with a wooden spoon,
and enact the ancient freeholder. The experiment was not successful,
he tired of the manual work, and returning to Stockholm, became
master of the new Elementary School, and began to write text-books
and educational works. His publication of a number of epics,
dramas, lyrics, and romances made him suddenly famous. Viewed
as a whole, this collection is generally called 'The Book of the
Rose,' but at times 'En Irrande Hind' (A Stray Deer). Of this, the
two dramas, 'Signora Luna' and 'Ramido Marinesco,' contain some
of the pearls of Swedish literature. Uneven in the plan and execution,
they are yet masterly in dialogue, and their dramatic and
tragic force is great. Almquist's imagination showed itself as individual
as it is fantastic. Coming from a man hitherto known as the
writer of text-books and the advocate of popular social ideas, the
volumes aroused extraordinary interest. The author revealed himself
as akin to Novalis and Victor Hugo, with a power of language like
that of Atterbom, and a richness of color resembling Tegn&egrave;r's. Atterbom
himself wrote of 'T&ouml;rnrosens Bok' that it was a work whose
&quot;faults were exceedingly easy to overlook and whose beauties exceedingly
difficult to match.&quot;</p>

<p>After this appeared in rapid succession, and written with equal
ease, lyrical, dramatic, educational, poetical, aesthetical, philosophical,
moral, and religious treatises, as well as lectures and studies in history
and law; for Almquist now gave all his time to literary labors.
His novels showed socialistic sympathies, and he put forth newspaper
articles and pamphlets on Socialism which aroused considerable
opposition. Moreover, he delighted in contradictions. One day he
wrote as an avowed Christian, extolling virtue, piety, and Christian
knowledge; the next, he abrogated religion as entirely unnecessary:
and his own explanation of this variability was merely--&quot;I paint so
because it pleases me to paint so, and life is not otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1851 was heard the startling rumor that he was accused of
forgery and charged with murder. He fled from Sweden and disappeared
from the knowledge of men. Going to America, he earned
under a fictitious name a scanty living, and became, it is said, the
private secretary of Abraham Lincoln. In 1866 he found himself
again under the ban of the law, his papers were destroyed, and he
escaped with difficulty to Bremen, where he died.</p>

<p>One of his latest works was his excellent modern novel, 'Det G&aring;r
An' (It's All Right), a forerunner of the &quot;problem novel&quot; of the day.
It is an attack upon conventional marriage, and pictures the helplessness
of a woman in the hands of a depraved man. Its extreme
views called out violent criticism.</p>

<p>He was a romanticist through and through, with a strong leaning
toward the French school. Among the best of his tales are 'Araminta
May,' 'Sk&auml;llnora Quarn' (Sk&auml;llnora's Mill), and 'Grimstahamns
Nybygge' (Grimstahamn's Settlement). His idyl 'Kapellet' (The
Chapel) is wonderfully true to nature, and his novel 'Palatset' (The
Palace) is rich in humor and true poesy. His literary fame will
probably rest on his romances, which are the best of their kind in
Swedish literature.</p>

<h3><a name="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_CATTLE"></a>CHARACTERISTICS OF CATTLE</h3>

<p>Any one with a taste for physiognomy should carefully observe
the features of the ox and the cow; their demeanor and
the expression of their eyes. They are figures which bear
an extraordinary stamp of respectability. They look neither joyful
nor melancholy. They are seldom evilly disposed, but never
sportive. They are full of gravity, and always seem to be going
about their business. They are not merely of great economic
service, but their whole persons carry the look of it. They are
the very models of earthly carefulness.</p>

<p>Nothing is ever to be seen more dignified, more official-looking,
than the whole behavior of the ox; his way of carrying his
head, and looking around him. If anybody thinks I mean these
words for a sarcasm, he is mistaken: no slur on official life, or
on what the world calls a man's vocation, is intended. I hold
them all in as much respect as could be asked. And though I
have an eye for contours, no feeling of ridicule is connected in
my mind with any of these. On the contrary, I regard the ox
and the cow with the warmest feelings of esteem. I admire in
them a na&iuml;ve and striking picture of one who minds his own
business; who submits to the claims of duty, not using the
word in its highest sense; who in the world's estimate is dignified,
steady, conventional, and middle-aged,--that is to say,
neither youthful nor stricken in years.</p>

<p>Look at that ox which stands before you, chewing his cud
and gazing around him with such unspeakable thoughtfulness--but
which you will find, when you look more closely into his
eyes, is thinking about nothing at all. Look at that discreet,
excellent Dutch cow, which, gifted with an inexhaustible udder,
stands quietly and allows herself to be milked as a matter of
course, while she gazes into space with a most sensible expression.
Whatever she does, she does with the same imperturbable
calmness, and as when a person leaves an important trust to his
own time and to posterity. If the worth of this creature is
thus great on the one side, yet on the other it must be confessed
that she possesses not a single trait of grace, not a
particle of vivacity, and none of that quick characteristic retreating
from an object which indicates an internal buoyancy, an
elastic temperament, such as we see in a bird or fish....
There is something very agreeable in the varied lowing of cattle
when heard in the distant country, and when replied to by a
large herd, especially toward evening and amid echoes. On the
other hand, nothing is more unpleasant than to hear all at once,
and just beside one, the bellowing of a bull, who thus authoritatively
announces himself, as if nobody else had any right to
utter a syllable in his presence.</p>

<h3><a name="A_NEW_UNDINE"></a>A NEW UNDINE</h3>

<center>From 'The Book of the Rose'</center>

<p>Miss Rudensk&ouml;ld and her companion sat in one of the pews
in the cheerful and beautiful church of Normalm, which
is all that is left of the once famous cloister of St. Clara,
and still bears the saint's name. The sermon was finished, and
the strong full tones of the organ, called out by the skillful
hands of an excellent organist, hovered like the voices of unseen
angel choirs in the high vaults of the church, floated down to
the listeners, and sank deep into their hearts.</p>

<p>Azouras did not speak a single word; neither did she sing,
for she did not know a whole hymn through. Nor did Miss
Rudensk&ouml;ld sing, because it was not her custom to sing in
church. During the organ solo, however, Miss Rudensk&ouml;ld ventured
to make some remarks about Dr. Asplund's sermon which
was so beautiful, and about the notices afterward which were so
tiresome. But when her neighbor did not answer, but sat looking
ahead with large, almost motionless eyes, as people stare
without looking at anything in particular, she changed her subject.</p>

<p>At one of the organ tones which finished a cadence, Azouras
started, and blinked quickly with her eyelids, and a light sigh
showed that she came back to herself and her friend, from her
vague contemplative state of mind. Something indescribable,
very sad, shone in her eyes, and made them almost black; and
with a childlike look at Miss Rudensk&ouml;ld she asked, &quot;Tell me
what that large painting over there represents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The altar-piece? Don't you know? The altar-piece in Clara
is one of the most beautiful we possess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is going on there?&quot; asked Azouras.</p>

<p>Miss Rudensk&ouml;ld gave her a side glance; she did not know
that her neighbor in the pew was a girl without baptism, without
Christianity, without the slightest knowledge of holy religion,
a heathen--and knew less than a heathen, for such a one has
his teachings, although they are not Christian. Miss Rudensk&ouml;ld
thought the girl's question came of a momentary forgetfulness,
and answered, to remind her:--</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, it is one of the usual subjects, but unusually
well painted, that is all. High up among the other figures in
the painting you will see the half-reclining figure of one that is
dead--see what an expression the painter has put into the face!--That
is the Saviour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Saviour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, God's son, you know; or God Himself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he is dead?&quot; repeated Azouras to herself with wondering
eyes. &quot;Yes, I believe that; it must be so: it is godlike to
die!&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Rudensk&ouml;ld looked at her neighbor with wide-opened
eyes. &quot;You must not misunderstand this subject,&quot; she said. &quot;It
is human to live and want to live; you can see that, too, in the
altar-piece, for all the persons who are human beings, like ourselves,
are alive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us go out! I feel oppressed by fear--no, I will tarry
here until my fear passes away. Go, dearest, I will send you
word.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Rudensk&ouml;ld took leave of her; went out of the church
and over the churchyard to the Eastern Gate, which faces Oden's
lane....</p>

<p>The girl meanwhile stayed inside; came to a corner in the
organ stairs; saw people go out little by little; remained unobserved,
and finally heard the sexton and the church-keeper go
away. When the last door was closed, Azouras stepped out of
her hiding-place. Shut out from the entire world, severed from
all human beings, she found herself the only occupant of the
large, light building, into which the sun lavishly poured his gold.</p>

<p>Although she was entirely ignorant of our holy church customs
and the meaning of the things she saw around her, she had
nevertheless, sometimes in the past, when her mother was in
better health, been present at the church service as a pastime,
and so remembered one thing and another. The persons with
whom she lived, in the halls and corridors of the opera, hardly
ever went to God's house; and generally speaking, church-going
was not practiced much during this time. No wonder, then, that
a child who was not a member of any religious body, and who
had never received an enlightening word from any minister,
should neglect what the initiated themselves did not attend to
assiduously.</p>

<p>She walked up the aisle, and never had the sad, strange feeling
of utter loneliness taken hold of her as it did now; it was
coupled with the apprehension of a great, overhanging danger.
Her heart beat wildly; she longed unspeakably--but for what?
for her wild free forest out there, where she ran around quick as
a deer? or for what?</p>

<p>She walked up toward the choir and approached the altar railing.
&quot;Here at least--I remember that once--but that was long
ago, and it stands like a shadow before my memory--I saw many
people kneel here: it must have been of some use to them?
Suppose I did likewise?&quot;</p>

<p>Nevertheless she thought it would be improper for her to
kneel down on the decorated cushions around the chancel. She
folded her hands and knelt outside of the choir on the bare stone
floor. But what more was she to do or say now? Of what use
was it all? Where was she to turn?</p>

<p>She knew nothing. She looked down into her own thoughts
as into an immense, silent dwelling. Feelings of sorrow and a
sense of transiency moved in slow swells, like shining, breaking
waves, through her consciousness. &quot;Oh--something to lean on--a
help--where? where? where?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked quietly about her; she saw nobody. She was sure
to meet the most awful danger when the door was opened, if
help did not come first.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes back toward the organ, and in her
thoughts she besought grace of the straight, long, shining pipes.
But all their mouths were silent now.</p>

<p>She looked up to the pulpit; nobody was standing there. In
the pews nobody. She had sent everybody away from here and
from herself.</p>

<p>She turned her head again toward the choir. She remembered
that when she had seen so many gathered here, two ministers
in vestments had moved about inside of the railing and
had offered the kneeling worshipers something. No doubt to
help them! But now--there was nobody inside there. To be
sure she was kneeling here with folded hands and praying eyes;
but there was nobody, nobody, nobody who offered her the least
little thing. She wept.</p>

<p>She looked out of the great church windows to the clear
noonday sky; her eyes beheld the delicate azure light which
spread itself over everything far, far away, but on nothing could
her eyes rest. There were no stars to be seen now, and the sun
itself was hidden by the window post, although its mild golden
light flooded the world.</p>

<p>She looked away again, and her eyes sank to the ground.
Her knees were resting on a tombstone, and she saw many of
the same kind about her. She read the names engraven on the
stones; they were all Swedish, correct and well-known. &quot;Oh,&quot;
she said to herself with a sigh, &quot;I have not a name like others!
My names have been many, borrowed,--and oh, often changed.
I did not get one to be my very own! If only I had one like
other people! Nobody has written me down in a book as I have
heard it said others are written down. Nobody asks about me.
I have nothing to do with anybody! Poor Azouras,&quot; she whispered
low to herself. She wept much.</p>

<p>There was no one else who said &quot;poor Azouras Tintomara!&quot;
but it was as if an inner, higher, invisible being felt sorry for
the outer, bodily, visible being, both one and the same person
in her. She wept bitterly over herself.</p>

<p>&quot;God is dead,&quot; she thought, and looked up at the large altar-piece
again. &quot;But I am a human being; I must live.&quot; And
she wept more heartily, more bitterly....</p>

<p>The afternoon passed, and the hour for vespers struck. The
bells in the tower began to lift their solemn voices, and keys
rattled in the lock. Then the heathen girl sprang up, and, much
like a thin vanishing mist, disappeared from the altar. She hid
in her corner again. It seemed to her that she had been forward,
and had taken liberties in the choir of the church to
which she had no right; and that in the congregation coming in
now, she saw persons who had a right to everything.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the harmonious tones of the organ began
to mix with the fragrant summer air in the church, Azouras
stood radiant, and she felt quickly how the weight lifted from
her breast. Was it because of the tears she had shed? Or did
an unknown helper at this moment scatter the fear in her heart?</p>

<p>She felt no more that it would be dangerous to leave the
church; she stole away, before vespers were over, came out into
the churchyard and turned off to the northern gate.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHANNA_AMBROSIUS"></a>JOHANNA AMBROSIUS</h2>

<h3>(1854-)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-b.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>efore the year 1895 the name of the German peasant, Johanna
Ambrosius, was hardly known, even within her own country.
Now her melodious verse has made her one of the most
popular writers in Germany. Her genius found its way from the
humble farm in Eastern Prussia, where she worked in the field beside
her husband, to the very heart of the great literary circles. She was
born in Lengwethen, a parish village in Eastern Prussia, on the 3d of
August, 1854. She received only the commonest education, and every
day was filled with the coarsest toil. But her mind and soul were
uplifted by the gift of poetry, to which she gave voice in her rare
moments of leisure. A delicate, middle-aged woman, whose simplicity
is undisturbed by the lavish praises of literary men, she leads the
most unpretending of lives. Her work became known by the merest
chance. She sent a poem to a German weekly, where it attracted the
attention of a Viennese gentleman, Dr. Schrattenthal, who collected
her verses and sent the little volume into the world with a preface
by himself. This work has already gone through twenty-six editions.
The short sketch cited, written some years ago, is the only prose of
hers that has been published.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristics of the poetry of this singularly
gifted woman are the deep, almost painfully intense earnestness pervading
its every line, the fine sense of harmony and rhythmic felicity
attending the comparatively few attempts she has thus far made, and
her tender touch when dwelling upon themes of the heart and home.
One cannot predict what her success will be when she attempts more
ambitious flights, but thus far she seems to have probed the aesthetic
heart of Germany to its centre.</p>

<h3><a name="A_PEASANT'S_THOUGHTS"></a>A PEASANT'S THOUGHTS</h3>

<p>The first snow, in large and thick flakes, fell gently and silently
on the barren branches of the ancient pear-tree, standing
like a sentinel at my house door. The first snow of the
year speaks both of joy and sadness. It is so comfortable to sit
in a warm room and watch the falling flakes, eternally pure and
lovely. There are neither flowers nor birds about, to make you
see and hear the beautiful great world. Now the busy peasant
has time to read the stories in his calendar. And I, too, stopped
my spinning-wheel, the holy Christ-child's gift on my thirteenth
birthday, to fold my hands and to look through the calendar of
my thoughts.</p>

<p>I did not hear a knock at the door, but a little man came in
with a cordial &quot;Good morning, little sister!&quot; I knew him well
enough, though we were not acquaintances. Half familiar, half
strange, this little time-worn figure looked. His queer face
seemed stamped out of rubber, the upper part sad, the lower
full of laughing wrinkles. But his address surprised me, for we
were not in the least related. I shook his horny hand, responding,
&quot;Hearty thanks, little brother.&quot; &quot;I call this good luck,&quot;
began little brother: &quot;a room freshly scoured, apples roasting in
the chimney, half a cold duck in the cupboard; and you all alone
with cat and clock. It is easier talking when there are two, for
the third is always in the way.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man amused me immensely. I sat down on the
bench beside him and asked after his wife and family. &quot;Thanks,
thanks,&quot; he nodded, &quot;all well and happy except our nestling
Ille. She leaves home to-morrow, to eat her bread as a dress-maker
in B--.&quot;--&quot;And the other children, where are they?&quot;
&quot;Flown away, long ago! Do you suppose, little sister, that I
want to keep all fifteen at home like so many cabbages in
a single bed?&quot; Fifteen children! Almost triumphantly, little
brother watched me. I owned almost as many brothers and
sisters myself, and fifteen children were no marvel to me. So I
asked if he were a grandfather too.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; he answered gravely. &quot;But I am going to tell
you how I came by fifteen children. You know how we peasant
folk give house and land to the eldest son, and only a few
coppers to the youngest children. A bad custom, that leads to
quarrels, and ends sometimes in murder. Fathers and mothers
can't bring themselves to part with the property, and so they
live with the eldest son, who doles out food and shelter, and gets
the farm in the end. So, in time, a family has some rich members
and more paupers. Now, we'd better sell the land and let
the children share alike; but then that way breaks estates too.
I was a younger child, and I received four hundred thalers;--a
large sum forty years ago. I didn't know anything but field
work. The saying that 'The peasant must be kept stupid or he
will not obey' was still printed in all the books. So I had to
look about for a family where a son was needed. One day, with
my four hundred thalers in my pocket, I went to a farm where
there was an unmarried daughter. When you go a-courting
among us, you pretend to mean to buy a horse. That's the
fashion. With us, a lie doesn't wear French rouge. The parents
of Marianne (that was her name) made me welcome. Brown
Bess was brought from the stable, and her neck, legs, and teeth
examined. I showed my willingness to buy her, which meant as
much as to say, 'Your daughter pleases me.' As proud as you
please, I walked through the buildings. Everything in plenty, all
right, not a nail wanting on the harrow, nor a cord missing from
the harness. How I strutted! I saw myself master, and I was
tickled to death to be as rich as my brother.</p>

<p>&quot;But I reckoned without my host. On tiptoe I stole into the
kitchen, where my sweetheart was frying ham and eggs. I
thought I might snatch a kiss. Above the noise of the sizzling
frying-pan and the crackling wood, I plainly heard the voice of
my--well, let us say it--bride, weeping and complaining to an
old house servant: 'It's a shame and a sin to enter matrimony
with a lie. I can't wed this Michael: not because he is ugly;
that doesn't matter in a man, but he comes too late! My heart
belongs to poor Joseph, the woodcutter, and I'd sooner be turned
out of doors than to make a false promise. Money blinds my
mother's eyes!' Don't be surprised, little sister, that I remember
these words so well. A son doesn't forget his father's blessing,
nor a prisoner his sentence. This was my sentence to poverty
and single-blessedness. I sent word to Marianne that she should
be happy--and so she was.</p>

<p>&quot;But now to my own story. I worked six years as farm hand
for my rich brother, and then love overtook me. The little
housemaid caught me in the net of her golden locks. What a
fuss it made in our family! A peasant's pride is as stiff as that
of your 'Vous' and 'Zus.' My girl had only a pair of willing
hands and a good heart to give to an ugly, pock-marked being
like me. My mother (God grant her peace!) caused her many a
tear, and when I brought home my Lotte she wouldn't keep the
peace until at last she found out that happiness depends on kindness
more than on money. On the patch of land that I bought,
my wife and I lived as happily as people live when there's love
in the house and a bit of bread to spare. We worked hard and
spent little. A long, scoured table, a wooden bench or so, a
chest or two of coarse linen, and a few pots and pans--that was
our furniture. The walls had never tasted whitewash, but Lotte
kept them scoured. She went to church barefoot, and put on
her shoes at the door. Good things such as coffee and plums,
that the poorest hut has now-a-days, we never saw. We didn't
save much, for crops sold cheap. But I didn't speculate, nor
squeeze money from the sweat of the poor. In time five pretty
little chatterboxes arrived, all flaxen-haired girls with blue eyes,
or brown. I was satisfied with girls, but the mother hankered
after a boy. That's a poor father that prefers a son to a
daughter. A man ought to take boys and girls alike, just as
God sends them. I was glad enough to work for my girls, and
I didn't worry about their future, nor build castles in the air for
them to live in. After fifteen years the boy arrived, but he took
himself quickly out of the world and coaxed his mother away
with him.&quot;</p>

<p>Little brother was silent, and bowed his snow-white head. My
heart felt as if the dead wife flitted through the room and gently
touched the old fellow's thin locks. I saw him kneeling at her
death-bed, heard the little girls sobbing, and waited in silence till
he drew himself up, sighing deeply:--</p>

<p>&quot;My Lotte died; she left me alone. What didn't I promise
the dear Lord in those black hours! My life, my savings, yea, all
my children if He would but leave her to me. In vain. 'My
thoughts are not thy thoughts, saith the Lord, and My ways
are not thy ways.' It was night in my soul. I cried over my
children, and I only half did my work. At night I tumbled into
bed tearless and prayerless. Oh, sad time! God vainly knocked at
my heart's door until the children fell ill. Oh, what would become
of me if these flowers were gathered? What wealth these rosy
mouths meant to me, how gladly would they smile away my sorrow!
I had set myself up above the Lord. But by my children's
bedside I prayed for grace. They all recovered. I took my
motherless brood to God's temple to thank Him there. Church-going
won't bring salvation, but staying away from church makes
a man stupid and coarse.</p>

<p>&quot;But I am forgetting, little sister. I started to tell you
about my fifteen children. You see I made up my mind that I
had to find a mother for the chicks. I wouldn't chain a young
thing to my bonds, even if she understood housekeeping. I held
to the saying, 'Equal wealth, equal birth, equal years make a
good match.' When an old widower courts a young girl he looks
at her faults with a hundred eyes when he measures her with
his first wife. But a home without a wife is like spring without
blossoms. So, thinking this way, I chose a widow with ten
children.&quot;</p>

<p>Twirling his thumbs, little brother smiled gayly as he looked
at me. &quot;Five and ten make fifteen, I thought, and when fifteen
prayers rise to heaven, the Lord must hear. My two eldest
stepsons entered military service. We wouldn't spend all our
money on the boys and then console our poor girls with a husband.
I put three sons to trades. But my girls were my pride.
They learned every kind of work. When they could cook, wash,
and spin, we sent them into good households to learn more.
Two married young. Some of the rest are seamstresses and
housekeepers. One is a secretary, and our golden-haired Miez is
lady's-maid to the Countess H----. Both these girls are betrothed.
Miez is the brightest, and she managed to learn, even
at the village school. So much is written about education nowadays,&quot;
(little brother drew himself up proudly as he added, &quot;I
take a newspaper,&quot;) &quot;but the real education is to keep children
at work and make them unselfish. They must love their work.
Work and pray, these were my rules, and thank Heaven! all my
children are good and industrious.</p>

<p>&quot;Just think, last summer my dear girls sent me a suit of fine
city clothes and money to go a journey, begging their old father
to make them a visit. Oh, how pretty they looked when they
showed me round the city in spite of my homespun, for I
couldn't bring myself to wear the fine clothes, after all. The
best dressed one was our little lady's-maid, who had a gold watch
in her belt. So I said: 'Listen, child, that is not fit for you.'
But she only laughed. 'Indeed it is, little father. If my gracious
lady makes me a present, I'm not likely to be mistaken for
her on that account.'--'And girls, are you contented to be in
service?'--'Certainly, father: unless there are both masters and
servants the world would go out of its grooves. My good
Countess makes service so light, that we love and serve her.
Yes, little father,' added Miez, 'my gracious mistress chose Gustav
for me, and is going to pay for the wedding and start us in
housekeeping--God bless her!' Now see what good such a
woman does. If people would but learn that it takes wits to
command as well as to obey, they would get along well enough
in these new times of equality. Thank heaven! we country folk
shan't be ruined by idleness. When I saw my thatched roof
again, among the fir-trees, I felt as solemn as if I were going to
prayers. The blue smoke looked like incense. I folded my
hands, I thanked God.&quot;</p>

<p>Little brother arose, his eyes bright with tears. He cast a
wistful look toward the apples in the chimney: &quot;My old wife,
little sister?&quot;--&quot;Certainly, take them all, little brother, you are
heartily welcome to them.&quot;--&quot;We are like children, my wife and
I, we carry tidbits to each other, now that our birds have all
flown away.&quot;--&quot;That is right, old boy, and God keep thee!&quot; I
said. From the threshold the words echoed back, &quot;God keep
thee!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="EDMONDO_DE_AMICIS"></a>EDMONDO DE AMICIS</h2>

<h3>(1846-)</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-i.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>n 1869, 'Vita Militare' (Military Life), a collection of short
stories, was perhaps the most popular Italian volume of the
year. Read alike in court and cottage, it was everywhere
discussed and enthusiastically praised. Its prime quality was that
quivering sympathy which insures some success to any imaginative
work, however crudely written. But these sketches of all the grim
and amusing phases of Italian soldier life are drawn with an exquisite
precision. The reader feels the breathless discouragement of
the tired soldiers when new dusty vistas are revealed by a sudden
turn in the road ('A Midsummer March'); understands the strong
silent love between officer and orderly, suppressed by military etiquette
('The Orderly'); smiles with the soldiers at the pretty runaway
boy, idol of the regiment ('The Son of the Regiment'); pities
the humiliations of the conscript novice ('The Conscript'); thrills
with the proud sorrow of the old man whose son's colonel tells the
story of his heroic death ('Dead on the Field of Battle'). &quot;When I
had finished reading it,&quot; said an Italian workman, &quot;I would gladly
have pressed the hand of the first soldier whom I happened to
meet.&quot; The author was only twenty-three, and has since given the
world many delightful volumes, but nothing finer.</p>

<p class="lft"><img src="images/480.png" width="50%" alt=""></p>

<p>These sketches were founded upon personal knowledge, for De
Amicis began life as a soldier. After his early education at Coni
and Turin, he entered the military school at Modena, from which he
was sent out as sub-lieutenant in the third regiment of the line. He
saw active service in various expeditions against Sicilian brigands;
and in the war with Austria he fought at the battle of Custozza.</p>

<p>His literary power seems to have been early
manifest; for in 1867 he became manager
of a newspaper, L'Italia Militare, at Florence;
and in 1871, yielding to his friends'
persuasions, he settled down to authorship
at Turin. His second book was the 'Ricordi,'
memorials dedicated to the youth of Italy,
of national events which had come within
his experience. Half a dozen later stories
published together were also very popular,
especially 'Gli Amici di Collegio' (College
Friends), 'Fortezza,' and 'La Casa Paterna'
(The Paternal Home). He has written
some graceful verse as well.</p>

<p>But De Amicis soon craved the stimulus of novel environments,
of differing personalities; and he set out upon the travels which he
has so delightfully recounted. This ardent Italian longed for the
repose of &quot;a gray sky,&quot; a critic tells us. He went first to Holland,
and experienced a joyous satisfaction in the careful art of that trim
little land. Later, a visit to North Africa in the suite of the Italian
ambassador prompted a brilliant volume, &quot;Morocco,&quot; &quot;which glitters
and flashes like a Damascus blade.&quot; Among his other well-known
books, descriptive of other trips, are 'Holland and Its People,'
'Spain,' 'London,' 'Paris,' and 'Constantinople,' which, translated
into many languages, have been widely read.</p>

<p>That unfortunate though not uncommon traveler who finds <i>ennui</i>
everywhere must envy De Amicis his inexhaustible enthusiasm, his
power of epicurean enjoyment in the color and glory of every land.
His is a curiously optimistic nature. Always perceiving the beautiful
and picturesque in art and nature, he treats other aspects hopefully,
and ignores them when he may. He catches what is characteristic
in every nation as inevitably as he catches the physiognomy of a
land with its skies and its waters, its flowers and its atmosphere.
His is a realism transfigured by poetic imagination, which divines
essential things and places them in high relief.</p>

<p>Very early in life De Amicis announced his love and admiration
of Manzoni, of whom he called himself a disciple. But his is a very
different mind. This Italian, born at On&eacute;glia of Genoese parents,
has inherited the emotional nature of his country. He sees everything
with feeling, penetrating below the surface with sympathetic
insight. Italy gives him his sensuous zest in life. But from France,
through his love of her vigor and grace, his cordial admiration of
her literature, he has gained a refining and strengthening influence.
She has taught him that direct diction, that choice simplicity, which
forsakes the stilted Italian of literary tradition for a style far
simpler, stronger, and more natural.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_LIGHT"></a>THE LIGHT</h3>

<center>From 'Constantinople'</center>

<p>And first of all, the light! One of my dearest delights at Constantinople
was to see the sun rise and set, standing upon
the bridge of the Sultana Valid&eacute;. At dawn, in autumn, the
Golden Horn is almost always covered by a light fog, behind
which the city is seen vaguely, like those gauze curtains that
descend upon the stage to conceal the preparations for a scenic
spectacle. Scutari is quite hidden; nothing is to be seen but the
dark uncertain outline of her hills. The bridge and the shores
are deserted, Constantinople sleeps; the solitude and silence render
the spectacle more solemn. The sky begins to grow golden
behind the hills of Scutari. Upon that luminous strip are drawn,
one by one, black and clear, the tops of the cypress trees in the
vast cemetery, like an army of giants ranged upon the heights;
and from one cape of the Golden Horn to the other there shines
a tremulous light, faint as the first murmur of the awakening
city. Then behind the cypresses of the Asiatic shore comes forth
an eye of fire, and suddenly the white tops of the four minarets
of Saint Sophia are tinted with deep rose. In a few minutes,
from hill to hill, from mosque to mosque, down to the end of the
Golden Horn, all the minarets, one after the other, turn rose
color; all the domes, one by one, are silvered, the flush descends
from terrace to terrace, the tremulous light spreads, the great
veil melts, and all Stamboul appears, rosy and resplendent upon
her heights, blue and violet along the shores, fresh and young, as
if just risen from the waters.</p>

<p>As the sun rises, the delicacy of the first tints vanishes in an
immense illumination, and everything remains bathed in white
light until toward evening. Then the divine spectacle begins
again. The air is so limpid that from Galata one can see clearly
every distant tree, as far as Kadi-Kioi. The whole of the
immense profile of Stamboul stands out against the sky with such
a clearness of line and rigor of color, that every minaret, obelisk,
and cypress-tree can be counted, one by one, from Seraglio Point
to the cemetery of Eyub. The Golden Horn and the Bosphorus
assume a wonderful ultramarine color; the heavens, the color of
amethyst in the East, are afire behind Stamboul, tinting the horizon
with infinite lights of rose and carbuncle, that make one
think of the first day of the creation; Stamboul darkens, Galata
becomes golden, and Scutari, struck by the last rays of the setting
sun, with every pane of glass giving back the glow, looks
like a city on fire.</p>

<p>And this is the moment to contemplate Constantinople. There
is one rapid succession of the softest tints, pallid gold, rose and
lilac, which quiver and float over the sides of the hills and the
water, every moment giving and taking away the prize of beauty
from each part of the city, and revealing a thousand modest
graces of the landscape that have not dared to show themselves
in the full light. Great melancholy suburbs are lost in the
shadow of the valleys; little purple cities smile upon the heights;
villages faint as if about to die; others die at once like extinguished
flames; others, that seemed already dead, revive, and
glow, and quiver yet a moment longer under the last ray of the
sun. Then there is nothing left but two resplendent points upon
the Asiatic shore,--the summit of Mount Bulgurlu, and the
extremity of the cape that guards the entrance to the Propontis;
they are at first two golden crowns, then two purple caps, then
two rubies; then all Constantinople is in shadow, and ten thousand
voices from ten thousand minarets announce the close of
the day.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="RESEMBLANCES"></a>RESEMBLANCES</h3>

<center>From 'Constantinople'</center>

<p>In the first days, fresh as I was from the perusal of Oriental
literature, I saw everywhere the famous personages of history
and legend, and the figures that recalled them resembled
sometimes so faithfully those that were fixed in my imagination,
that I was constrained to stop and look at them. How many
times have I seized my friend by the arm, and pointing to a
person passing by, have exclaimed: &quot;It is he, <i>cospetto!</i> do you
not recognize him?&quot; In the square of the Sultana Valid&eacute;, I frequently
saw the gigantic Turk who threw down millstones from
the walls of Nicaea on the heads of the soldiers of Baglione; I
saw in front of a mosque Umm Djemil, that old fury that sowed
brambles and nettles before Mahomet's house; I met in the book
bazaar, with a volume under his arm, Djemaleddin, the learned
man of Broussa, who knew the whole of the Arab dictionary by
heart; I passed quite close to the side of Ayesha, the favorite
wife of the Prophet, and she fixed upon my face her eyes, brilliant
and humid, like the reflection of stars in a well; I have
recognized, in the At-Meidan, the famous beauty of that poor
Greek woman killed by a cannon ball at the base of the serpentine
column; I have been face to face, in the Fanar, with Kara-Abderrahman,
the handsome young Turk of the time of Orkhan;
I have seen Coswa, the she-camel of the Prophet; I have encountered
Kara-bulut, Selim's black steed; I have met the poor
poet Fignahi, condemned to go about Stamboul tied to an ass
for having pierced with an insolent distich the Grand Vizier of
Ibrahim; I have been in the same caf&eacute; with Soliman the Big,
the monstrous admiral, whom four robust slaves hardly succeeded
in lifting from the divan; Ali, the Grand Vizier, who could not
find in all Arabia a horse that could carry him; Mahmoud Pasha,
the ferocious Hercules that strangled the son of Soliman; and the
stupid Ahmed Second, who continually repeated &quot;Koso! Koso!&quot;
(Very well, very well) crouching before the door of the copyists'
bazaar, in the square of Bajazet. All the personages of the
'Thousand and One Nights,' the Aladdins, the Zobeides, the
Sindbads, the Gulnares, the old Jewish merchants, possessors of
enchanted carpets and wonderful lamps, passed before me like a
procession of phantoms.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="BIRDS"></a>BIRDS</h3>

<center>From 'Constantinople'</center>

<p>Constantinople has one grace and gayety peculiar to itself,
that comes from an infinite number of birds of every kind,
for which the Turks nourish a warm sentiment and regard.
Mosques, groves, old walls, gardens, palaces, all resound with
song, the whistling and twittering of birds; everywhere wings
are fluttering, and life and harmony abound. The sparrows enter
the houses boldly, and eat out of women's and children's hands;
swallows nest over the caf&eacute; doors, and under the arches of the
bazaars; pigeons in innumerable swarms, maintained by legacies
from sultans and private individuals, form garlands of black and
white along the cornices of the cupolas and around the terraces
of the minarets; sea-gulls dart and play over the water; thousands
of turtle-doves coo amorously among the cypresses in the cemeteries;
crows croak about the Castle of the Seven Towers halcyons
come and go in long files between the Black Sea and
the Sea of Marmora; and storks sit upon the cupolas of the
mausoleums. For the Turk, each one of these birds has a gentle
meaning, or a benignant virtue: turtle-doves are favorable to
lovers, swallows keep away fire from the roofs where they build
their nests, storks make yearly pilgrimages to Mecca, halcyons
carry the souls of the faithful to Paradise. Thus he protects and
feeds them, through a sentiment of gratitude and piety; and they
enliven the house, the sea, and the sepulchre. Every quarter of
Stamboul is full of the noise of them, bringing to the city a sense
of the pleasures of country life, and continually refreshing the
soul with a reminder of nature.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="CORDOVA"></a>CORDOVA</h3>

<center>From 'Spain'</center>

<p>For a long distance the country offers no new aspect to the
feverish curiosity of the tourist. At Vilches there is a vast
plain, and beyond there the open country of Tolosa, where
Alphonso VIII., King of Castile, gained the celebrated victory
&quot;de las Navas&quot; over the Mussulman army. The sky was very
clear, and in the distance one could see the mountains of the
Sierra de Segura. Suddenly, there comes over one a sensation
which seems to respond to a suppressed exclamation of surprise:
the first aloes with their thick leaves, the unexpected heralds of
tropical vegetation, rise on both sides of the road. Beyond, the
fields studded with flowers begin to appear. The first are studded,
those which follow almost covered, then come vast stretches of
ground entirely clothed with poppies, daisies, lilies, wild mushrooms,
and ranunculuses, so that the country (as it presents itself
to view) looks like a succession of immense purple, gold, and
snowy-hued carpets. In the distance, among the trees, are innumerable
blue, white, and yellow streaks, as far as the eye can
reach; and nearer, on the banks of the ditches, the elevations of
ground, the slopes, and even on the edge of the road are flowers
in beds, clumps, and clusters, one above the other, grouped in
the form of great bouquets, and trembling on their stalks, which
one can almost touch with his hand. Then there are fields white
with great blades of grain, flanked by plantations of roses, orange
groves, immense olive groves, and hillsides varied by a thousand
shades of green, surmounted by ancient Moorish towers, scattered
with many-colored houses; and between the one and the other
are white and slender bridges that cross rivulets hidden by the
trees.</p>

<p>On the horizon appear the snowy caps of the Sierra Nevada;
under that white streak lie the undulating blue ones of the nearer
mountains. The country becomes more varied and flourishing;
Arjonilla lies in a grove of olives, whose boundary one cannot
see; Pedro Abad, in the midst of a plain, covered with vineyards
and fruit-trees; Ventas di Alcolea, on the last hills of the Sierra
Nevada, peopled with villas and gardens. We are approaching
Cordova, the train flies along, we see little stations half hidden
by trees and flowers, the wind carries the rose leaves into the
carriages, great butterflies fly near the windows, a delicious perfume
permeates the air, the travelers sing; we pass through an
enchanted garden, the aloes, oranges, palms, and villas grow
more frequent; and at last we hear a cry--&quot;Here is Cordova!&quot;</p>

<p>How many lovely pictures and grand recollections the sound
of that name awakens in one's mind! Cordova,--the ancient
pearl of the East, as the Arabian poets call it,--the city of
cities; Cordova of the thirty suburbs and three thousand mosques,
which inclosed within her walls the greatest temple of Islam!
Her fame extended throughout the East, and obscured the glory
of ancient Damascus. The faithful came from the most remote
regions of Asia to banks of the Guadalquivir to prostrate themselves
in the marvelous Mihrab of her mosque, in the light of the
thousand bronze lamps cast from the bells of the cathedrals of
Spain. Hither flocked artists, savants, poets from every part of
the Mahometan world to her flourishing schools, immense libraries,
and the magnificent courts of her caliphs. Riches and
beauty flowed in, attracted by the fame of her splendor. From
here they scattered, eager for knowledge, along the coasts of
Africa, through the schools of Tunis, Cairo, Bagdad, Cufa, and
even to India and China, in order to gather inspiration and
records; and the poetry sung on the slopes of the Sierra Morena
flew from lyre to lyre, as far as the valleys of the Caucasus, to
excite the ardor for pilgrimages. The beautiful, powerful, and
wise Cordova, crowned with three thousand villages, proudly
raised her white minarets in the midst of orange groves, and
spread around the valley a voluptuous atmosphere of joy and
glory.</p>

<p>I leave the train, cross a garden, look around me. I am
alone. The travelers who were with me disappear here and
there; I still hear the noise of a carriage which is rolling off;
then all is quiet. It is midday, the sky is very clear, and the
air suffocating. I see two white houses; it is the opening of a
street; I enter and go on. The street is narrow, the houses as
small as the little villas on the slopes of artificial gardens,
almost all one story in height, with windows a few feet from
the ground, the roofs so low that one could almost touch them
with a stick, and the walls very white. The street turns; I
look, see no one, and hear neither step nor voice. I say to
myself:--&quot;This must be an abandoned street!&quot; and try another
one, in which the houses are white, the windows closed, and
there is nothing but silence and solitude around me. &quot;Why,
where am I?&quot; I ask myself. I go on; the street, which is so
narrow that a carriage could not pass, begins to wind; on the
right and left I see other deserted streets, white houses, and
closed windows. My step resounds as if in a corridor. The
whiteness of the walls is so vivid that even the reflection is
trying, and I am obliged to walk with my eyes half closed, for
it really seems as if I were making my way through the snow.
I reach a small square; everything is closed, and no one is to
be seen. At this point a vague feeling of melancholy seizes
me, such as I have never experienced before; a mixture of
pleasure and sadness, similar to that which comes to children
when, after a long run, they reach a lonely rural spot and
rejoice in their discovery, but with a certain trepidation lest
they should be too far from home. Above many roofs rise the
palm-trees of inner gardens. Oh, fantastic legends of Odalisk
and Caliph! On I go from street to street, and square to
square; I begin to meet some people, but they pass and disappear
like phantoms. All the streets resemble each other; the
houses have only three or four windows; and not a spot, scrawl,
or crack is to be seen on the walls, which are as smooth and
white as a sheet of paper. From time to time I hear a whisper
behind a blind, and see, almost at the same moment, a dark
head, with a flower in the hair, appear and disappear. I look
in at a door....</p>

<p>A <i>patio!</i> How shall I describe a <i>patio?</i> It is not a court,
nor a garden, nor a room; but it is all three things combined.
Between the patio and the street there is a vestibule. On the
four sides of the patio rise slender columns, which support, up
to a level with the first floor, a species of gallery inclosed in
glass; above the gallery is stretched a canvas, which shades the
court. The vestibule is paved with marble, the door flanked
by columns, surmounted by bas-reliefs, and closed by a slender
iron gate of graceful design. At the end of the patio there is
a fountain; and all around are scattered chairs, work-tables,
pictures, and vases of flowers. I run to another door: there is
another patio, with its walls covered with ivy, and a number of
niches holding little statues, busts, and urns. I look in at a third
door: here is another patio, with its walls worked in mosaics, a
palm in the centre, and a mass of flowers all around. I stop at
a fourth door: after the patio there is another vestibule, after this
a second patio, in which one sees other statues, columns, and
fountains. All these rooms and gardens are so neat and clean
that one could pass his hand over the walls and on the ground
without leaving a trace; and they are fresh, odorous, and lighted
by an uncertain light, which increases their beauty and mysterious
appearance.</p>

<p>On I go at random from street to street. As I walk, my
curiosity increases and I quicken my pace. It seems impossible
that a whole city can be like this; I am afraid of stumbling
across some house or coming into some street that will remind
me of other cities, and disturb my beautiful dream. But no, the
dream lasts; for everything is small, lovely, and mysterious. At
every hundred steps I reach a deserted square, in which I stop
and hold my breath; from time to time there appears a cross-road,
and not a living soul is to be seen; everything is white,
the windows closed, and silence reigns on all sides. At each
door there is a new spectacle; there are arches, columns, flowers,
jets of water, and palms; a marvelous variety of design, tints,
light, and perfume; here the odor of roses, there of oranges,
farther on of pinks; and with this perfume a whiff of fresh air,
and with the air a subdued sound of women's voices, the rustling
of leaves, and the singing of birds. It is a sweet and varied
harmony, that without disturbing the silence of the streets,
soothes the ear like the echo of distant music. Ah! it is not a
dream! Madrid, Italy, Europe, are indeed far away! Here one
lives another life, and breathes the air of a different world,--for
I am in the East.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="THE_LAND_OF_PLUCK"></a>THE LAND OF PLUCK</h3>

<center>From 'Holland and Its People'</center>

<p>Whoever looks for the first time at a large map of Holland
wonders that a country so constituted can continue to
exist. At the first glance it is difficult to see whether
land or water predominates, or whether Holland belongs most to
the continent or to the sea. Those broken and compressed
coasts; those deep bays; those great rivers that, losing the aspect
of rivers, seem bringing new seas to the sea; that sea which,
changing itself into rivers, penetrates the land and breaks it into
archipelagoes; the lakes, the vast morasses, the canals crossing
and recrossing each other, all combine to give the idea of a
country that may at any moment disintegrate and disappear.
Seals and beavers would seem to be its rightful inhabitants; but
since there are men bold enough to live in it, they surely cannot
ever sleep in peace.</p>

<p>What sort of a country Holland is, has been told by many in
few words. Napoleon said it was an alluvion of French rivers,--the
Rhine, the Scheldt, and the Meuse,--and with this pretext he
added it to the Empire. One writer has defined it as a sort of
transition between land and sea. Another, as an immense crust
of earth floating on the water. Others, an annex of the old
continent, the China of Europe, the end of the earth and the
beginning of the ocean, a measureless raft of mud and sand;
and Philip II. called it the country nearest to hell.</p>

<p>But they all agreed upon one point, and all expressed it in
the same words:--Holland is a conquest made by man over the
sea; it is an artificial country: the Hollanders made it; it exists
because the Hollanders preserve it; it will vanish whenever the
Hollanders shall abandon it.</p>

<p>To comprehend this truth, we must imagine Holland as it was
when first inhabited by the first German tribes that wandered
away in search of a country.</p>

<p>It was almost uninhabitable. There were vast tempestuous
lakes, like seas, touching one another; morass beside morass; one
tract after another covered with brushwood; immense forests of
pines, oaks, and alders, traversed by herds of wild horses, and
so thick were these forests that tradition says one could travel
leagues passing from tree to tree without ever putting foot to the
ground. The deep bays and gulfs carried into the heart of the
country the fury of the northern tempests. Some provinces disappeared
once every year under the waters of the sea, and were
nothing but muddy tracts, neither land nor water, where it was
impossible either to walk or to sail. The large rivers, without
sufficient inclination to descend to the sea, wandered here and
there uncertain of their way, and slept in monstrous pools and
ponds among the sands of the coasts. It was a sinister place,
swept by furious winds, beaten by obstinate rains, veiled in a
perpetual fog, where nothing was heard but the roar of the sea
and the voices of wild beasts and birds of the ocean. The first
people who had the courage to plant their tents there, had to
raise with their own hands dikes of earth to keep out the rivers
and the sea, and lived within them like shipwrecked men upon
desolate islands, venturing forth at the subsidence of the waters
in quest of food in the shape of fish and game, and gathering the
eggs of marine birds upon the sand.</p>

<p>Caesar, passing by, was the first to name this people. The
other Latin historians speak with compassion and respect of these
intrepid barbarians who lived upon a &quot;floating land,&quot; exposed to
the intemperance of a cruel sky and the fury of the mysterious
northern sea; and the imagination pictures the Roman soldiers,
who, from the heights of the uttermost citadels of the empire,
beaten by the waves, contemplated with wonder and pity those
wandering tribes upon their desolate land, like a race accursed of
heaven.</p>

<p>Now, if we remember that such a region has become one of
the most fertile, wealthiest, and best regulated of the countries
of the world, we shall understand the justice of the saying that
Holland is a conquest made by man. But, it must be added, the
conquest goes on forever.</p>

<p>To explain this fact--to show how the existence of Holland,
in spite of the great defensive works constructed by the inhabitants,
demands an incessant and most perilous struggle--it will
be enough to touch here and there upon a few of the principal
vicissitudes of her physical history, from the time when her
inhabitants had already reduced her to a habitable country.</p>

<p>Tradition speaks of a great inundation in Friesland in the
sixth century. From that time every gulf, every island, and it
may be said every city, in Holland has its catastrophe to record.
In thirteen centuries, it is recorded that one great inundation,
beside smaller ones, has occurred every seven years; and the
country being all plain, these inundations were veritable floods.
Towards the end of the thirteenth century, the sea destroyed a
part of a fertile peninsula near the mouth of the Ems, and swallowed
up more than thirty villages. In the course of the same
century, a series of inundations opened an immense chasm in
northern Holland, and formed the Zuyder Zee, causing the death
of more than eighty thousand persons. In 1421 a tempest swelled
the Meuse, so that in one night the waters overwhelmed seventy-two
villages and one hundred thousand inhabitants. In 1532 the
sea burst the dikes of Zealand, destroying hundreds of villages,
and covering forever a large tract of country. In 1570 a storm
caused another inundation in Zealand and in the province of
Utrecht; Amsterdam was invaded by the waters, and in Friesland
twenty thousand people were drowned. Other great inundations
took place in the seventeenth century; two terrible ones at
the beginning and the end of the eighteenth; one in 1825 that
desolated North Holland, Friesland, Over-Yssel, and Gueldres;
and another great one of the Rhine, in 1855, which invaded
Gueldres and the province of Utrecht, and covered a great part
of North Brabant. Beside these great catastrophes, there happened
in different centuries innumerable smaller ones, which
would have been famous in any other country, but which in
Holland are scarcely remembered: like the rising of the lake of
Haarlem, itself the result of an inundation of the sea; flourishing
cities of the gulf of Zuyder Zee vanished under the waters; the
islands of Zealand covered again and again by the sea, and again
emerging; villages of the coast, from Helder to the mouths of
the Meuse, from time to time inundated and destroyed; and in
all these inundations immense loss of life of men and animals.
It is plain that miracles of courage, constancy, and industry must
have been accomplished by the Hollanders, first in creating and
afterwards in preserving such a country. The enemy from which
they had to wrest it was triple: the sea, the lakes, the rivers.
They drained the lakes, drove back the sea, and imprisoned the
rivers.</p>

<p>To drain the lakes the Hollanders pressed the air into their
service. The lakes, the marshes, were surrounded by dikes, the
dikes by canals; and an army of windmills, putting in motion
force-pumps, turned the water into the canals, which carried it
off to the rivers and the sea. Thus vast tracts of land buried
under the water saw the sun, and were transformed, as if by
magic, into fertile fields, covered with villages, and intersected by
canals and roads. In the seventeenth century, in less than forty
years, twenty-six lakes were drained. At the beginning of the
present century, in North Holland alone, more than six thousand
hectares (or fifteen thousand acres) were thus redeemed from the
waters; in South Holland, before 1844, twenty-nine thousand
hectares; in the whole of Holland, from 1500 to 1858, three hundred
and fifty-five thousand hectares. Substituting steam-mills
for windmills, in thirty-nine months was completed the great
undertaking of the draining of the lake of Haarlem, which measured
forty-four kilometres in circumference, and forever threatened
with its tempests the cities of Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Leyden.
And they are now meditating the prodigious work of drying up
the Zuyder Zee, which embraces an area of more than seven
hundred square kilometres.</p>

<p>The rivers, another eternal enemy, cost no less of labor and
sacrifice. Some, like the Rhine, which lost itself in the sands
before reaching the sea, had to be channeled and defended at
their mouths, against the tides, by formidable cataracts; others,
like the Meuse, bordered by dikes as powerful as those that
were raised against the ocean; others, turned from their course;
the wandering waters gathered together; the course of the affluents
regulated; the waters divided with rigorous measure in order
to retain that enormous mass of liquid in equilibrium, where the
slightest inequality might cost a province; and in this way all
the rivers that formerly spread their devastating floods about
the country were disciplined into channels and constrained to do
service.</p>

<p>But the most tremendous struggle was the battle with the
ocean. Holland is in great part lower than the level of the sea;
consequently, everywhere that the coast is not defended by sand
banks it has to be protected by dikes. If these interminable bulwarks
of earth, granite, and wood were not there to attest the
indomitable courage and perseverance of the Hollanders, it would
not be believed that the hand of man could, even in many centuries,
have accomplished such a work. In Zealand alone the
dikes extend to a distance of more than four hundred kilometres.
The western coast of the island of Walcheren is defended by a
dike, in which it is computed that the expense of construction
added to that of preservation, if it were put out at interest,
would amount to a sum equal in value to that which the dike
itself would be worth were it made of massive copper. Around
the city of Helder, at the northern extremity of North Holland,
extends a dike ten kilometres long, constructed of masses of Norwegian
granite, which descends more than sixty metres into the
sea. The whole province of Friesland, for the length of eighty-eight
kilometres, is defended by three rows of piles sustained by
masses of Norwegian and German granite. Amsterdam, all the
cities of the Zuyder Zee, and all the islands,--fragments of vanished
lands,--which are strung like beads between Friesland and
North Holland, are protected by dikes. From the mouths of the
Ems to those of the Scheldt, Holland is an impenetrable fortress,
of whose immense bastions the mills are the towers, the cataracts
are the gates, the islands the advanced forts; and like a true
fortress, it shows to its enemy, the sea, only the tops of its bell-towers
and the roofs of its houses, as if in defiance and derision.</p>

<p>Holland is a fortress, and her people live as in a fortress, on
a war footing with the sea. An army of engineers, directed by
the Minister of the Interior, spread over the country, and, ordered
like an army, continually spy the enemy, watch over the internal
waters, foresee the bursting of the dikes, order and direct the
defensive works. The expenses of the war are divided,--one
part to the State, one part to the provinces; every proprietor
pays, beside the general imposts, a special impost for the dikes,
in proportion to the extent of his lands and their proximity to
the water. An accidental rupture, an inadvertence, may cause a
flood; the peril is unceasing; the sentinels are at their posts upon
the bulwarks; at the first assault of the sea, they shout the war-cry,
and Holland sends men, material, and money. And even
when there is no great battle, a quiet, silent struggle is forever
going on. The innumerable mills, even in the drained districts,
continue to work unresting, to absorb and turn into the canals
the water that falls in rain and that which filters in from the sea.
Every day the cataracts of the bays and rivers close their gigantic
gates against the high tide trying to rush into the heart of
the land. The work of strengthening dikes, fortifying sand-banks
with plantations, throwing out new dikes where the banks are
low, straight as great lances, vibrating in the bosom of the sea
and breaking the first impetus of the wave, is forever going on.
And the sea eternally knocks at the river-gates, beats upon the
ramparts, growls on every side her ceaseless menace, lifting her
curious waves as if to see the land she counts as hers, piling up
banks of sand before the gates to kill the commerce of the cities,
forever gnawing, scratching, digging at the coast; and failing to
overthrow the ramparts upon which she foams and fumes in
angry effort, she casts at their feet ships full of the dead, that
they may announce to the rebellious country her fury and her
strength.</p>

<p>In the midst of this great and terrible struggle Holland is
transformed: Holland is the land of transformations. A geographical
map of that country as it existed eight centuries ago
is not recognizable. Transforming the sea, men also are transformed.
The sea, at some points, drives back the land; it takes
portions from the continent, leaves them and takes them again;
joins islands to the mainland with ropes of sand, as in the case
of Zealand; breaks off bits from the mainland and makes new
islands, as in Wieringen; retires from certain coasts and makes
land cities out of what were cities of the sea, as Leuvarde; converts
vast tracts of plain into archipelagoes of a hundred islets,
as Biisbosch; separates a city from the land, as Dordrecht; forms
new gulfs two leagues broad, like the gulf of Dollart; divides
two provinces with a new sea, like North Holland and Friesland.
The effect of the inundations is to cause the level of the sea to
rise in some places and to sink in others; sterile lands are fertilized
by the slime of the rivers, fertile lands are changed into
deserts of sand. With the transformations of the waters alternate
the transformations of labor. Islands are united to continents,
like the island of Ameland; entire provinces are reduced to
islands, as North Holland will be by the new canal of Amsterdam,
which is to separate it from South Holland; lakes as large
as provinces disappear altogether, like the lake of Beemster; by
the extraction of peat, land is converted into lakes, and these
lakes are again transformed into meadows. And thus the country
changes its aspect according to the violence of nature or the
needs of men. And while one goes over it with the latest map
in hand, one may be sure that the map will be useless in a few
years, because even now there are new gulfs in process of formation,
tracts of land just ready to be detached from the mainland,
and great canals being cut that will carry life to uninhabited districts.</p>

<p>But Holland has done more than defend herself against the
waters; she has made herself mistress of them, and has used
them for her own defense. Should a foreign army invade her
territory, she has but to open her dikes and unchain the sea and
the rivers, as she did against the Romans, against the Spaniards,
against the army of Louis XIV., and defend the land cities with
her fleet. Water was the source of her poverty, she has made
it the source of wealth. Over the whole country extends an
immense network of canals, which serves both for the irrigation
of the land and as a means of communication. The cities, by
means of canals, communicate with the sea; canals run from
town to town, and from them to villages, which are themselves
bound together by these watery ways, and are connected even to
the houses scattered over the country; smaller canals surround
the fields and orchards, pastures and kitchen-gardens, serving at
once as boundary wall, hedge, and road-way; every house is a
little port. Ships, boats, rafts, move about in all directions, as
in other places carts and carriages. The canals are the arteries
of Holland, and the water her life-blood. But even setting aside
the canals, the draining of the lakes, and the defensive works, on
every side are seen the traces of marvelous undertakings. The
soil, which in other countries is a gift of nature, is in Holland a
work of men's hands. Holland draws the greater part of her
wealth from commerce; but before commerce comes the cultivation
of the soil; and the soil had to be created. There were
sand-banks interspersed with layers of peat, broad downs swept
by the winds, great tracts of barren land apparently condemned
to an eternal sterility. The first elements of manufacture, iron
and coal, were wanting; there was no wood, because the forests
had already been destroyed by tempests when agriculture began;
there was no stone, there were no metals. Nature, says a Dutch
poet, had refused all her gifts to Holland; the Hollanders had to
do everything in spite of nature. They began by fertilizing the
sand. In some places they formed a productive soil with earth
brought from a distance, as a garden is made; they spread the
siliceous dust of the downs over the too watery meadows; they
mixed with the sandy earth the remains of peat taken from the
bottoms; they extracted clay to lend fertility to the surface of
their lands; they labored to break up the downs with the plow:
and thus in a thousand ways, and continually fighting off the
menacing waters, they succeeded in bringing Holland to a state
of cultivation not inferior to that of more favored regions. That
Holland, that sandy, marshy country which the ancients considered
all but uninhabitable, now sends out yearly from her confines
agricultural products to the value of a hundred millions of
francs, possesses about one million three hundred thousand head
of cattle, and in proportion to the extent of her territory may be
accounted one of the most populous of European States.</p>

<p>It may be easily understood how the physical peculiarities of
their country must influence the Dutch people; and their genius
is in perfect harmony with the character of Holland. It is sufficient
to contemplate the monuments of their great struggle with
the sea in order to understand that their distinctive characteristics
must be firmness and patience, accompanied by a calm and constant
courage. That glorious battle, and the consciousness of
owing everything to their own strength, must have infused and
fortified in them a high sense of dignity and an indomitable spirit
of liberty and independence. The necessity of a constant struggle,
of a continuous labor, and of perpetual sacrifices in defense of
their existence, forever taking them back to a sense of reality,
must have made them a highly practical and economical people;
good sense should be their most salient quality, economy one of
their chief virtues; they must be excellent in all useful arts,
sparing of diversion, simple even in their greatness; succeeding
in what they undertake by dint of tenacity and a thoughtful and
orderly activity; more wise than heroic; more conservative than
creative; giving no great architects to the edifice of modern
thought, but the ablest of workmen, a legion of patient and
laborious artisans. And by virtue of these qualities of prudence,
phlegmatic activity, and the spirit of conservatism, they are ever
advancing, though by slow degrees; they acquire gradually, but
never lose what they have gained; holding stubbornly to their
ancient customs; preserving almost intact, and despite the neighborhood
of three great nations, their own originality; preserving
it through every form of government, through foreign invasions,
through political and religious wars, and in spite of the immense
concourse of strangers from every country that are always coming
among them; and remaining, in short, of all the northern races,
that one which, though ever advancing in the path of civilization,
has kept its antique stamp most clearly.</p>

<p>It is enough also to remember its form in order to comprehend
that this country of three millions and a half of inhabitants,
although bound in so compact a political union, although recognizable
among all the other northern peoples by certain traits
peculiar to the population of all its provinces, must present a
great variety. And so it is in fact. Between Zealand and Holland
proper, between Holland and Friesland, between Friesland
and Gueldres, between Groningen and Brabant, in spite of
vicinity and so many common tics, there is no less difference
than between the more distant provinces of Italy and France;
difference of language, costume, and character; difference of race
and of religion. The communal regime has impressed an indelible
mark upon this people, because in no other country does it
so conform to the nature of things. The country is divided into
various groups of interests organized in the same manner as the
hydraulic system. Whence, association and mutual help against
the common enemy, the sea; but liberty for local institutions
and forces. Monarchy has not extinguished the ancient municipal
spirit, and this it is that renders impossible a complete fusion
of the State, in all the great States that have made the attempt.
The great rivers and gulfs are at the same time commercial
roads serving as national bonds between the different provinces,
and barriers which defend old traditions and old customs in each.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DUTCH_MASTERS"></a>THE DUTCH MASTERS</h3>

<center>From 'Holland and Its People'</center>

<p>The Dutch school of painting has one quality which renders it
particularly attractive to us Italians; it is above all others
the most different from our own, the very antithesis or the
opposite pole of art. The Dutch and Italian schools are the most
original, or, as has been said, the only two to which the title
rigorously belongs; the others being only daughters or younger
sisters, more or less resembling them.</p>

<p>Thus even in painting Holland offers that which is most sought
after in travel and in books of travel: the new.</p>

<p>Dutch painting was born with the liberty and independence of
Holland. As long as the northern and southern provinces of the
Low Countries remained under the Spanish rule and in the Catholic
faith, Dutch painters painted like Belgian painters; they studied
in Belgium, Germany, and Italy; Heemskerk imitated Michael
Angelo, Bloemart followed Correggio, and &quot;Il Moro&quot; copied
Titian, not to indicate others: and they were one and all pedantic
imitators, who added to the exaggerations of the Italian style a
certain German coarsenesss, the result of which was a bastard
style of painting, still inferior to the first, childish, stiff in design,
crude in color, and completely wanting in chiaroscuro, but at least
not a servile imitation, and becoming, as it were, a faint prelude
of the true Dutch art that was to be.</p>

<p>With the war of independence, liberty, reform, and painting
also were renewed. With religious traditions fell artistic traditions;
the nude nymphs, Madonnas, saints, allegory, mythology,
the ideal--all the old edifice fell to pieces. Holland, animated by
a new life, felt the need of manifesting and expanding it in a
new way; the small country, become all at once glorious and
formidable, felt the desire for illustration; the faculties which had
been excited and strengthened in the grand undertaking of creating
a nation, now that the work was completed, overflowed and
ran into new channels. The conditions of the country were favorable
to the revival of art. The supreme dangers were conjured
away; there was security, prosperity, a splendid future; the heroes
had done their duty, and the artists were permitted to come to
the front; Holland, after many sacrifices, and much suffering,
issued victoriously from the struggle, lifted her face among her
people and smiled. And that smile is art.</p>

<p>What that art would necessarily be, might have been guessed
even had no monument of it remained. A pacific, laborious, practical
people, continually beaten down, to quote a great German
poet, to prosaic realities by the occupations of a vulgar burgher
life; cultivating its reason at the expense of its imagination; living,
consequently, more in clear ideas than in beautiful images;
taking refuge from abstractions; never darting its thoughts beyond
that nature with which it is in perpetual battle; seeing only that
which is, enjoying only that which it can possess, making its happiness
consist in the tranquil ease and honest sensuality of a life
without violent passions or exorbitant desires;--such a people
must have tranquillity also in their art, they must love an art that
pleases without startling the mind, which addresses the senses
rather than the spirit; an art full of repose, precision, and delicacy,
though material like their lives: in one word, a realistic art,
in which they can see themselves as they are and as they are content
to be.</p>

<p>The artists began by tracing that which they saw before their
eyes--the house. The long winters, the persistent rains, the
dampness, the variableness of the climate, obliged the Hollander
to stay within doors the greater part of the year. He loved his
little house, his shell, much better than we love our abodes, for
the reason that he had more need of it, and stayed more within
it; he provided it with all sorts of conveniences, caressed it, made
much of it; he liked to look out from his well-stopped windows
at the falling snow and the drenching rain, and to hug himself
with the thought, &quot;Rage, tempest, I am warm and safe!&quot; Snug
in his shell, his faithful housewife beside him, his children about
him, he passed the long autumn and winter evenings in eating
much, drinking much, smoking much, and taking his well-earned
ease after the cares of the day were over. The Dutch painters
represented these houses and this life in little pictures proportionate
to the size of the walls on which they were to hang; the bedchambers
that make one feel a desire to sleep, the kitchens, the
tables set out, the fresh and smiling faces of the house-mothers,
the men at their ease around the fire; and with that conscientious
realism which never forsakes them, they depict the dozing cat, the
yawning dog, the clucking hen, the broom, the vegetables, the
scattered pots and pans, the chicken ready for the spit. Thus
they represent life in all its scenes, and in every grade of the
social scale--the dance, the <i>conversazione</i>, the orgie, the feast, the
game; and thus did Terburg, Metzu, Netscher, Dow, Mieris, Steen,
Brouwer, and Van Ostade become famous.</p>

<p>After depicting the house, they turned their attention to the
country. The stern climate allowed but a brief time for the
admiration of nature, but for this very reason Dutch artists
admired her all the more; they saluted the spring with a livelier
joy, and permitted that fugitive smile of heaven to stamp itself
more deeply on their fancy. The country was not beautiful, but
it was twice dear because it had been torn from the sea and
from the foreign oppressor. The Dutch artist painted it lovingly;
he represented it simply, ingenuously, with a sense of
intimacy which at that time was not to be found in Italian or
Belgian landscape. The flat, monotonous country had, to the
Dutch painter's eyes, a marvelous variety. He caught all the
mutations of the sky, and knew the value of the water, with its
reflections, its grace and freshness, and its power of illuminating
everything. Having no mountains, he took the dikes for background;
with no forests, he imparted to a single group of trees
all the mystery of a forest; and he animated the whole with
beautiful animals and white sails.</p>

<p>The subjects of their pictures are poor enough,--a windmill,
a canal, a gray sky; but how they make one think! A few
Dutch painters, not content with nature in their own country,
came to Italy in search of hills, luminous skies, and famous
ruins; and another band of select artists is the result,--Both,
Swanevelt, Pynacker, Breenberg, Van Laer, Asselyn. But the
palm remains with the landscapists of Holland; with Wynants
the painter of morning, with Van der Neer the painter of night,
with Ruysdael the painter of melancholy, with Hobbema the
illustrator of windmills, cabins, and kitchen gardens, and with
others who have restricted themselves to the expression of the
enchantment of nature as she is in Holland.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with landscape art was born another kind of
painting, especially peculiar to Holland,--animal painting. Animals
are the riches of the country; that magnificent race of
cattle which has no rival in Europe for fecundity and beauty.
The Hollanders, who owe so much to them, treat them, one
may say, as part of the population; they wash them, comb
them, dress them, and love them dearly. They are to be seen
everywhere; they are reflected in all the canals, and dot with
points of black and white the immense fields that stretch on
every side, giving an air of peace and comfort to every place,
and exciting in the spectator's heart a sentiment of Arcadian gentleness
and patriarchal serenity. The Dutch artists studied these
animals in all their varieties, in all their habits, and divined, as
one may say, their inner life and sentiments, animating the tranquil
beauty of the landscape with their forms. Rubens, Luyders,
Paul de Vos, and other Belgian painters, had drawn animals with
admirable mastery; but all these are surpassed by the Dutch
artists Van der Velde, Berghem, Karel du Jardin, and by the
prince of animal painters, Paul Potter, whose famous &quot;Bull,&quot; in
the gallery of the Hague, deserves to be placed in the Vatican
beside the &quot;Transfiguration&quot; by Raphael.</p>

<p>In yet another field are the Dutch painters great,--the sea.
The sea, their enemy, their power, and their glory, forever
threatening their country, and entering in a hundred ways into
their lives and fortunes; that turbulent North Sea, full of sinister
color, with a light of infinite melancholy upon it, beating forever
upon a desolate coast, must subjugate the imagination of the
artist. He passes, indeed, long hours on the shore, contemplating
its tremendous beauty, ventures upon its waves to study the
effects of tempests, buys a vessel and sails with his wife and
family, observing and making notes, follows the fleet into battle
and takes part in the fight; and in this way are made marine
painters like William Van der Velde the elder and William the
younger, like Backhuysen, Dubbels, and Stork.</p>

<p>Another kind of painting was to arise in Holland, as the
expression of the character of the people and of republican
manners. A people which without greatness had done so many
great things, as Michelet says, must have its heroic painters, if
we call them so, destined to illustrate men and events. But this
school of painting,--precisely because the people were without
greatness, or to express it better, without the form of greatness,--modest,
inclined to consider all equal before the country,
because all had done their duty, abhorring adulation, and the
glorification in one only of the virtues and the triumph of
many,--this school has to illustrate not a few men who have
excelled, and a few extraordinary facts, but all classes of citizenship
gathered among the most ordinary and pacific of burgher
life. From this come the great pictures which represent five,
ten, thirty persons together, arquebusiers, mayors, officers, professors,
magistrates, administrators; seated or standing around a
table, feasting and conversing; of life size, most faithful likenesses;
grave, open faces, expressing that secure serenity of
conscience by which may be divined rather than seen the nobleness
of a life consecrated to one's country, the character of that
strong, laborious epoch, the masculine virtues of that excellent
generation; all this set off by the fine costume of the time, so
admirably combining grace and dignity,--those gorgets, those
doublets, those black mantles, those silken scarves and ribbons,
those arms and banners. In this field stand pre-eminent Van der
Helst, Hals, Govaert, Flink, and Bol.</p>

<p>Descending from the consideration of the various kinds of
painting, to the special manner by means of which the artist
excelled in treatment, one leads all the rest as the distinctive
feature of Dutch painting--the light.</p>

<p>The light in Holland, by reason of the particular conditions
of its manifestation, could not fail to give rise to a special manner
of painting. A pale light, waving with marvelous mobility
through an atmosphere impregnated with vapor, a nebulous veil
continually and abruptly torn, a perpetual struggle between light
and shadow,--such was the spectacle which attracted the eye of
the artist. He began to observe and to reproduce all this agitation
of the heavens, this struggle which animates with varied and
fantastic life the solitude of nature in Holland; and in representing
it, the struggle passed into his soul, and instead of representing
he created. Then he caused the two elements to contend
under his hand; he accumulated darkness that he might split and
seam it with all manner of luminous effects and sudden gleams
of light; sunbeams darted through the rifts, sunset reflections
and the yellow rays of lamp-light were blended with delicate
manipulation into mysterious shadows, and their dim depths
were peopled with half-seen forms; and thus he created all sorts
of contrasts, enigmas, play and effect of strange and unexpected
chiaroscuro. In this field, among many, stand conspicuous
Gerard Dow, the author of the famous four-candle picture, and
the great magician and sovereign illuminator Rembrandt.</p>

<p>Another marked feature of Dutch painting was to be color.
Besides the generally accepted reasons that in a country where
there are no mountainous horizons, no varied prospects, no great
<i>coup d'oeil</i>,--no forms, in short, that lend themselves to design,--the
artist's eye must inevitably be attracted by color; and that
this might be peculiarly the case in Holland, where the uncertain
light, the fog-veiled atmosphere, confuse and blend the outlines
of all objects, so that the eye, unable to fix itself upon the
form, flies to color as the principal attribute that nature presents
to it,--besides these reasons, there is the fact that in a country
so flat, so uniform, and so gray as Holland, there is the same
need of color as in southern lands there is need of shade. The
Dutch artists did but follow the imperious taste of their countrymen,
who painted their houses in vivid colors, as well as their
ships, and in some places the trunks of their trees and the
palings and fences of their fields and gardens; whose dress was
of the gayest, richest hues; who loved tulips and hyacinths even
to madness. And thus the Dutch painters were potent colorists,
and Rembrandt was their chief.</p>

<p>Realism, natural to the calmness and slowness of the Dutch character,
was to give to their art yet another distinctive feature,--finish,
which was carried to the very extreme of possibility. It
is truly said that the leading quality of the people may be found
in their pictures; viz., patience. Everything is represented with
the minuteness of a daguerreotype; every vein in the wood of a
piece of furniture, every fibre in a leaf, the threads of cloth, the
stitches in a patch, every hair upon an animal's coat, every
wrinkle in a man's face; everything finished with microscopic precision,
as if done with a fairy pencil, or at the expense of the
painter's eyes and reason. In reality a defect rather than an
excellence, since the office of painting is to represent not what <i>is</i>,
but what the eye sees, and the eye does not see everything; but
a defect carried to such a pitch of perfection that one admires,
and does not find fault. In this respect the most famous prodigies
of patience were Dow, Mieris, Potter, and Van der Heist,
but more or less all the Dutch painters.</p>

<p>But realism, which gives to Dutch art so original a stamp and
such admirable qualities, is yet the root of its most serious defects.
The artists, desirous only of representing material truths, gave to
their figures no expression save that of their physical sentiments.
Grief, love, enthusiasm, and the thousand delicate shades of feeling
that have no name, or take a different one with the different
causes that give rise to them, they express rarely, or not at all.
For them the heart does not beat, the eyes do not weep, the lips
do not quiver. One whole side of the human soul, the noblest
and highest, is wanting in their pictures. More: in their faithful
reproduction of everything, even the ugly, and especially the ugly,
they end by exaggerating even that, making defects into deformities
and portraits into caricatures; they calumniate the national
type; they give a burlesque and graceless aspect to the human
countenance. In order to have the proper background for such
figures, they are constrained to choose trivial subjects: hence the
great number of pictures representing beer-shops, and drinkers
with grotesque, stupid faces, in absurd attitudes; ugly women and
ridiculous old men; scenes in which one can almost hear the
brutal laughter and the obscene words. Looking at these pictures,
one would naturally conclude that Holland was inhabited by the
ugliest and most ill-mannered people on the earth. We will not
speak of greater and worse license. Steen, Potter, and Brouwer,
the great Rembrandt himself, have all painted incidents that are
scarcely to be mentioned to civilized ears, and certainly should
not be looked at. But even setting aside these excesses, in the
picture galleries of Holland there is to be found nothing that elevates
the mind, or moves it to high and gentle thoughts. You
admire, you enjoy, you laugh, you stand pensive for a moment
before some canvas; but coming out, you feel that something is
lacking to your pleasure, you experience a desire to look upon a
handsome countenance, to read inspired verses, and sometimes
you catch yourself murmuring, half unconsciously, &quot;O Raphael!&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, there are still two important excellences to be recorded
of this school of painting: its variety, and its importance as the
expression--the mirror, so to speak--of the country. If we
except Rembrandt with his group of followers and imitators,
almost all the other artists differ very much from one another;
no other school presents so great a number of original masters.
The realism of the Dutch painters is born of their common love
of nature: but each one has shown in his work a kind of love
peculiarly his own; each one has rendered a different impression
which he has received from nature; and all, starting from the
same point, which was the worship of material truth, have arrived
at separate and distinct goals. Their realism, then, inciting them
to disdain nothing as food for the pencil, has so acted that Dutch
art succeeds in representing Holland more completely than has
ever been accomplished by any other school in any other country.
It has been truly said that should every other visible witness of
the existence of Holland in the seventeenth century--her period
of greatness--vanish from the earth, and the pictures remain, in
them would be found preserved entire the city, the country, the
ports, the ships, the markets, the shops, the costumes, the arms,
the linen, the stuffs, the merchandise, the kitchen utensils, the
food, the pleasures, the habits, the religious belief and superstitions,
the qualities and effects of the people; and all this, which
is great praise for literature, is no less praise for her sister art.</p>

<h2><a name="HENRI_FREDERIC_AMIEL"></a>HENRI FR&Eacute;D&Eacute;RIC AMIEL</h2>

<h3>(1821-1881)</h3>

<h3>BY RICHARD BURTON</h3><br>

<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=""></p>
<p>he French have long been writers of what they call 'Pens&eacute;es,'--those
detached thoughts or meditations which, for depth,
illumination, and beauty, have a power of life, and come
under the term &quot;literature.&quot; Their language lends itself to the
expression of subjective ideas with lucidity, brilliance, charm. The
French quality of mind allows that expression to be at once dignified
and happily urbane. Sometimes these sayings take the form of the
cynical epigrams of a La Rochefoucauld; are expanded into sententious
aphorisms by a La Bruy&egrave;re; or reveal more earnest and athletic
souls, who pierce below the social surface froth to do battle with the
demons of the intellect. To this class belong men like the
seventeenth-century Pascal and the nineteenth-century Amiel.</p>

<p>The career of Henri Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Amiel illustrates the dubiety of too
hasty judgment of a man's place or power in the world. A Genevese
by birth, of good parentage, early orphaned, well educated,
much traveled, he was deemed, on his return in the springtime of
his manhood to his native town as professor in the Academy of
Geneva, to be a youth of great promise, destined to become distinguished.
But the years slipped by, and his literary performance,
consisting of desultory essays and several slight volumes of verse,
was not enough to justify the prophecy. His life more and more
became that of a bachelor recluse and valetudinarian. When he
died, in 1881, at sixty years of age, after much suffering heroically
borne, as pathetic entries in the last leaves of his Diary remain to
show, there was a feeling that here was &quot;one more faithful failure.&quot;
But the quiet, brooding teacher in the Swiss city which has at one
time or another immured so many rare minds, had for years been
jotting down his reflections in a private journal. It constitutes the
story of his inner life, never told in his published writings. When a
volume of the 'Journal Intime' appeared the year after his taking
off, the world recognized in it not only an intellect of clarity and
keenness, and a heart sensitive to the widest spiritual problems, but
the revelation of a typical modern mood. The result was that Amiel,
being dead, yet spoke to his generation, and his fame was quick and
genuine. The apparent disadvantage point of Geneva proved, after
all, the fittest abiding-place for the poet-philosopher. A second volume
of extracts, two years later, found him in an assured place as
a writer of 'Pens&eacute;es.'</p>

<p>The 'Journal' of Amiel is symptomatic of his time,--perhaps one
reason why it met with so sympathetic a response. It mirrors the
intellectual doubtings, the spiritual yearnings and despairs of a strenuous
and pure soul in a rationalistic atmosphere. In the day of
scientific test and of skepticism, of the readjustment of conventions
and the overthrow of sacrosanct traditions, one whose life is that of
thought rather than of action finds much to perplex, to weary, and
to sadden. So it was with the Swiss professor. He was always in
the sanctum sanctorum of his spirit, striving to attain the truth; with
Hamlet-like irresolution he poised in mind before the antinomies
of the universe, alert to see around a subject, having the modern
thinker's inability to be partisan. This way of thought is obviously
unhealthy, or at least has in it something of the morbid. It implies
the undue introspection which is well-nigh the disease of this century.
There is in it the failure to lose one's life in objective incident
and action, that one may find it again in regained balance of
mind and bodily health. Amiel had the defect of his quality; but
he is clearly to be separated from those shallow or exaggerated specimens
of subjectivity illustrated by present-day women diarists, like
Bashkirtseff and Kovalevsky. The Swiss poet-thinker had a vigor of
thought and a broad culture; his aim was high, his desire pure, and
his meditations were often touched with imaginative beauty. Again
and again he flashes light into the darkest penetralia of the human
soul. At times, too, there is in him a mystic fervor worthy of St.
Augustine. If his dominant tone is melancholy, he is not to be
called a pessimist. He believed in the Good at the central core of
things. Hence is he a fascinating personality, a stimulative force.
And these outpourings of an acute intellect, and a nature sensitive to
the Ideal, are conveyed in a diction full of literary feeling and flavor.
Subtlety, depth, tenderness, poetry, succeed each other; nor are the
crisp, compressed sayings, the happy <i>mots</i> of the epigrammatist,
entirely lacking. And pervading all is an impression of character.</p>

<p>Like Pascal, Amiel was a thinker interested above all in the soul
of man. He was a psychologist, seeking to know the secret of the
Whence, the Why, and the Whither. Like Joubert, whose journal
resembled his own in its posthumous publication, his reflections will
live by their weight, their quality, their beauty of form. Nor are
these earlier writers of "Pens&eacute;es" likely to have a more permanent
place among the seed-sowers of thought. Amiel himself declared
that &quot;the pens&eacute;e-writer is to the philosopher what the dilettante is
to the artist. He plays with thought, and makes it produce a crowd
of pretty things of detail; but he is more anxious about truths than
truth, and what is essential in thought, its sequence, its unity,
escapes him.... In a word, the pens&eacute;e-writer deals with what
is superficial and fragmentary.&quot; While these words show the fine
critical sense of the man, they do an injustice to his own work.
Fragmentary it is, but neither superficial nor petty. One recognizes
in reading his wonderfully suggestive pages that here is a rare
personality, indeed,--albeit &quot;sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
thought.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1889 an admirable English translation of Amiel by Mrs.
Humphry Ward, the novelist, appeared in London. The introductory
essay by Mrs. Ward is the best study of him in our language. The
appended selections are taken from the Ward translation.</p>

<h3><a name="EXTRACTS_FROM_AMIEL'S_JOURNAL"></a>EXTRACTS FROM AMIEL'S JOURNAL</h3>

<a name="Christ's_Real_Message"></a>
<p>October 1st, 1849.--Yesterday, Sunday, I read through and
made extracts from the Gospel of St. John. It confirmed
me in my belief that about Jesus we must believe no one
but Himself, and that what we have to do is to discover the true
image of the Founder behind all the prismatic refractions through
which it comes to us, and which alter it more or less. A ray of
heavenly light traversing human life, the message of Christ has
been broken into a thousand rainbow colors, and carried in a
thousand directions. It is the historical task of Christianity to
assume with every succeeding age a fresh metamorphosis, and to
be forever spiritualizing more and more her understanding of the
Christ and of salvation.</p>

<p>I am astounded at the incredible amount of Judaism and
formalism which still exists nineteen centuries after the Redeemer's
proclamation, &quot;It is the letter which killeth&quot;--after his protest
against a dead symbolism. The new religion is so profound
that it is not understood even now, and would seem a blasphemy
to the greater number of Christians. The person of Christ is the
centre of it. Redemption, eternal life, divinity, humanity, propitiation,
incarnation, judgment, Satan, heaven and hell,--all
these beliefs have been so materialized and coarsened that with a
strange irony they present to us the spectacle of things having a
profound meaning and yet carnally interpreted. Christian boldness
and Christian liberty must be reconquered; it is the Church
which is heretical, the Church whose sight is troubled and her
heart timid. Whether we will or no, there is an esoteric doctrine--there
is a relative revelation; each man enters into God so
much as God enters into him; or, as Angelus, I think, said, &quot;The
eye by which I see God is the same eye by which He sees me.&quot;</p>

<a name="Duty"></a>
<p>Duty has the virtue of making us feel the reality of a positive
world while at the same time detaching us from it.</p>

<a name="Joubert"></a>
<p>February 20th, 1851.--I have almost finished these two volumes
of [Joubert's] 'Pens&eacute;es' and the greater part of the
'Correspondance.' This last has especially charmed me; it
is remarkable for grace, delicacy, atticism, and precision. The
chapters on metaphysics and philosophy are the most insignificant.
All that has to do with large views, with the whole of things, is
very little at Joubert's command: he has no philosophy of history,
no speculative intuition. He is the thinker of detail, and his
proper field is psychology and matters of taste. In this sphere of
the subtleties and delicacies of imagination and feeling, within
the circle of personal affections and preoccupations, of social and
educational interests, he abounds in ingenuity and sagacity, in
fine criticisms, in exquisite touches. It is like a bee going from
flower to flower, a teasing, plundering, wayward zephyr, an
aeolian harp, a ray of furtive light stealing through the leaves.
Taken as a whole, there is something impalpable and immaterial
about him, which I will not venture to call effeminate, but which
is scarcely manly. He wants bone and body: timid, dreamy, and
clairvoyant, he hovers far above reality. He is rather a soul, a
breath, than a man. It is the mind of a woman in the character
of a child, so that we feel for him less admiration than tenderness
and gratitude.</p>

<a name="Greeks_vs_Moderns"></a>
<p>November 10th, 1852.--How much have we not to learn from
the Greeks, those immortal ancestors of ours! And how
much better they solved their problem than we have solved
ours! Their ideal man is not ours; but they understood infinitely
better than we, how to reverence, cultivate, and ennoble the
man whom they knew. In a thousand respects we are still barbarians
beside them, as B&eacute;ranger said to me with a sigh in 1843:
barbarians in education, in eloquence, in public life, in poetry, in
matters of art, etc. We must have millions of men in order to
produce a few elect spirits: a thousand was enough in Greece.
If the measure of a civilization is to be the number of perfected
men that it produces, we are still far from this model people.
The slaves are no longer below us, but they are among us. Barbarism
is no longer at our frontiers: it lives side by side with
us. We carry within us much greater things than they, but we
ourselves are smaller. It is a strange result. Objective civilization
produced great men while making no conscious effort toward
such a result; subjective civilization produces a miserable and imperfect
race, contrary to its mission and its earnest desire. The
world grows more majestic, but man diminishes. Why is this?</p>

<p>We have too much barbarian blood in our veins, and we lack
measure, harmony, and grace. Christianity, in breaking man up
into outer and inner, the world into earth and heaven, hell and
paradise, has decomposed the human unity, in order, it is true, to
reconstruct it more profoundly and more truly. But Christianity
has not yet digested this powerful leaven. She has not yet conquered
the true humanity; she is still living under the antinomy
of sin and grace, of here below and there above. She has not
penetrated into the whole heart of Jesus. She is still in the <i>narthex</i>
of penitence; she is not reconciled, and even the churches
still wear the livery of service, and have none of the joy of the
daughters of God, baptized of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Then, again, there is our excessive division of labor; our bad
and foolish education which does not develop the whole man; and
the problem of poverty. We have abolished slavery, but without
having solved the question of labor. In law, there are no more
slaves--in fact, there are many. And while the majority of men
are not free, the free man, in the true sense of the term, can
neither be conceived nor realized. Here are enough causes for
our inferiority.</p>

<a name="Nature_Teutonic"></a>
<p>November 12th, 1852.--St. Martin's summer is still lingering,
and the days all begin in mist. I ran for a quarter of an
hour round the garden to get some warmth and suppleness.
Nothing could be lovelier than the last rosebuds, or the delicate
gaufred edges of the strawberry leaves embroidered with hoar-frost,
while above them Arachne's delicate webs hung swaying in
the green branches of the pines,--little ball-rooms for the fairies,
carpeted with powdered pearls, and kept in place by a thousand
dewy strands, hanging from above like the chains of a lamp, and
supporting them from below like the anchors of a vessel. These
little airy edifices had all the fantastic lightness of the elf-world,
and all the vaporous freshness of dawn. They recalled to me the
poetry of the North, wafting to me a breath from Caledonia or
Iceland or Sweden, Frithjof and the Edda, Ossian and the Hebrides.
All that world of cold and mist, of genius and of reverie,
where warmth comes not from the sun but from the heart, where
man is more noticeable than nature,--that chaste and vigorous
world, in which will plays a greater part than sensation, and
thought has more power than instinct,--in short, the whole romantic
cycle of German and Northern poetry, awoke little by little
in my memory and laid claim upon my sympathy. It is a poetry
of bracing quality, and acts upon one like a moral tonic. Strange
charm of imagination! A twig of pine-wood and a few spider-webs
are enough to make countries, epochs, and nations live again
before her.</p>

<a name="Training_of_Children"></a>
<p>January 6th, 1853.--Self-government with tenderness,--here
you have the condition of all authority over children. The
child must discover in us no passion, no weakness of which
he can make use; he must feel himself powerless to deceive or to
trouble us; then he will recognize in us his natural superiors, and
he will attach a special value to our kindness, because he will respect
it. The child who can rouse in us anger, or impatience, or
excitement, feels himself stronger than we, and a child respects
strength only. The mother should consider herself as her child's
sun, a changeless and ever radiant world, whither the small restless
creature, quick at tears and laughter, light, fickle, passionate,
full of storms, may come for fresh stores of light, warmth, and
electricity, of calm and of courage. The mother represents goodness,
providence, law; that is to say, the divinity, under that form
of it which is accessible to childhood. If she is herself passionate,
she will inculcate in her child a capricious and despotic God, or
even several discordant gods. The religion of a child depends
on what its mother and its father are, and not on what they
say. The inner and unconscious ideal which guides their life is
precisely what touches the child; their words, their remonstrances,
their punishments, their bursts of feeling even, are for him
merely thunder and comedy; what they worship--this it is which
his instinct divines and reflects.</p>

<p>The child sees what we are, behind what we wish to be.
Hence his reputation as a physiognomist. He extends his power
as far as he can with each of us; he is the most subtle of diplomatists.
Unconsciously he passes under the influence of each
person about him, and reflects it while transforming it after his
his own nature. He is a magnifying mirror. This is why the
first principle of education is, Train yourself; and the first rule
to follow, if you wish to possess yourself of a child's will, is,
Master your own.</p>

<a name="Mozart_and_Beethoven"></a>
<p>December 17th, 1856.--This evening was the second quartet
concert. It stirred me much more than the first; the music
chosen was loftier and stronger. It was the quartette in D
minor of Mozart, and the quartette in C major of Beethoven, separated
by a Spohr concerto.</p>

<p>The work of Mozart, penetrated as it is with mind and
thought, represents a solved problem, a balance struck between
aspiration and executive capacity, the sovereignty of a grace
which is always mistress of itself, marvelous harmony and perfect
unity. His quartette describes a day in one of those Attic souls
who prefigure on earth the serenity of Elysium.</p>

<p>In Beethoven's, on the other hand, a spirit of tragic irony
paints for you the mad tumult of existence, as it dances forever
above the threatening abyss of the infinite. No more unity, no
more satisfaction, no more serenity! We are spectators of the
eternal duel between the two great forces, that of the abyss
which absorbs all finite things, and that of life which defends and
asserts itself, expands, and enjoys.</p>

<p>The soul of Beethoven was a tormented soul. The passion
and the awe of the infinite seemed to toss it to and fro from
heaven to hell. Hence its vastness. Which is the greater, Mozart
or Beethoven? Idle question! The one is more perfect, the other
more colossal. The first gives you the peace of perfect art, beauty
at first sight. The second gives you sublimity, terror, pity, a
beauty of second impression. The one gives that for which the
other rouses a desire. Mozart has the classic purity of light and
the blue ocean. Beethoven the romantic grandeur which belongs</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
